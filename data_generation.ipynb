Every day, it's the same cycle of waking up, going through the motions, and then lying in bed at night wondering if anything I did mattered.

Like they have their lives together while I'm just stuck in this endless loop of self-doubt and sadness. I try to put on a smile and pretend everything is fine, but deep down, I feel like I'm breaking apart. I keep asking myself, \"What's the point?\" but I never find an answer.

      "Iteration 27: Skipping line (invalid number of columns): Reasoning: The post reveals significant emotional distress and a pervasive sense of hopelessness. The poster describes feelings of emptiness, self-doubt, and a lack of purpose, which are common symptoms of depression. They mention going through daily routines without finding meaning, which indicates anhedonia—a loss of interest or pleasure in activities. The inability to share these feelings with others due to fear of judgment or misunderstanding further isolates them, exacerbating their emotional pain. The recurring thought of \"What's the point?\" suggests existential despair, a hallmark of depressive thinking. The overall tone and content of the post strongly align with the diagnostic criteria for depression, particularly regarding low mood, diminished interest in life, and feelings of worthlessness.  \n",

The poster describes feeling disconnected from their life and surroundings, as if they are an outside observer. This sense of disconnection and unreality aligns with symptoms of dissociation that can occur in severe depressive episodes. Additionally, the poster expresses feelings of invisibility and insignificance, which reflect low self-worth and a lack of emotional engagement with their environment. The recurring theme of questioning their identity and existence further underscores the depth of their emotional distress. These symptoms collectively suggest that the poster is experiencing depression, particularly with features of dissociation.  \n",

      "Iteration 27: Skipping line (invalid number of columns): Post: I’ve been feeling so tired lately, not just physically but emotionally too. It’s like every little thing takes so much effort, even things I used to enjoy. I’ve been canceling plans with friends because I just don’t have the energy to pretend I’m okay. I know they’re starting to notice, but I don’t know how to explain it without sounding dramatic. I keep telling myself it’s just stress from work, but deep down, I know it’s more than that. I feel like I’m stuck in this fog, and no matter what I do, I can’t seem to get out of it. I just want to sleep all the time, but even when I do, I wake up feeling exhausted.  \n",

      "Iteration 27: Skipping line (invalid number of columns): Reasoning: The post highlights several key symptoms of depression, including persistent fatigue, loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities, and social withdrawal. The poster describes feeling emotionally drained and unable to engage with others, which is indicative of anhedonia and emotional exhaustion. The mention of wanting to sleep excessively but still feeling tired upon waking suggests disturbances in sleep patterns, a common symptom of depression. Additionally, the poster’s inability to articulate their feelings to friends and their self-doubt about being \"dramatic\" reflect underlying feelings of guilt and low self-esteem, which are often present in depressive disorders. The overall tone of the post conveys a profound sense of being overwhelmed and trapped, consistent with a depressive episode.  \n",

      "Iteration 27: Skipping line (invalid number of columns): Reasoning: The post reveals significant emotional instability, including mood swings, irritability, and periods of emotional numbness, which are common symptoms of depression. The poster describes feeling out of control and unable to regulate their emotions, leading to social isolation and strained relationships. The alternating states of anger and numbness suggest a dysregulated emotional state, often seen in individuals experiencing depressive episodes. Additionally, the poster’s desire to be \"normal\" reflects feelings of inadequacy and self-criticism, which are characteristic of depressive thinking. The overall content and tone of the post indicate that the poster is struggling with emotional distress consistent with depression.  \n",

What’s wrong with me?\",\"Question: The answer to the question \\\"Does the poster suffer from depression?\\\" is\",\"yes. Reasoning: The post describes excessive sleep, persistent fatigue, and a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities—all classic symptoms of depression. The use of the word \\\"blah\\\" suggests anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure, which is a key indicator of depressive disorders. The poster’s confusion and concern about their state further underscore the emotional toll of their condition.\"\n",
