Now I have some data sets. I hope you can imitate the format and content of the data sets and randomly generate 1000 data sets.

The format is post, question, response.
And the data sets are as below.


"Post: How to avoid a relapse? I've been having a particularly rough year; I attempted suicide, the love of my life left me, I failed my year at university, I've been physically assaulted, I've been sexually assaulted and today my grandfather died. I feel like I'm running on empty and doing the bare minimum to survive for myself while trying to be a rock to others. My emotional resilience has been wiped out. I feel ""okay"" but I've felt like this in the past and it has turned out that I've just been lying to myself and making things worse. Any advice on how to manage/process my emotions? Or just how to better understand myself?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a significant amount of emotional distress, including experiencing a suicide attempt, multiple traumatic events, and the recent death of a family member. The poster describes feeling emotionally depleted, struggling to cope, and questioning their ability to understand and manage their own emotions. This level of emotional pain, trauma, and self-doubt aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression. The poster's request for advice on managing emotions and understanding oneself further suggests a need for additional support and resources to address their mental health."
"Post: This is how I feel and I have a slight sense I am the only one to think think this way. I am depressed? Help wanted I yearn for the days I was in high school. I felt as if I was always happy and never worried about anything. I am 22, just having graduated from University. It seems each day I am becoming a person who does not want to have a relationship with anyone other then my family. I want to be alone. Happiness to me is being sheltered by reality--alone with my thoughts. I deleted every single bit of social media I had about a year ago (SC, FB, Insta, Twitter, etc) in an attempt to become as alone as possible. I truly deep down wish I was never born, but I would never ever commit suicide. I wish more then anything else that I can just disappear and leave this world. I am studying for the MCAT currently. I don't have any problem doing so because of my extremely addictive personality, but I find that I enjoy things that take my mind off of reality. Studying, reading, listening to music or going for a drives are my favorite ways to achieve this. But the reality I see is that this world is shit. I believe that as a whole, humans are riddled with greed and selfishness that are the motivations behind MOST of everything in this world. And by humans, that obviously includes myself and I hate myself down to the core for the selfish things I have done. Maybe I am too cynical or something. But this bad world syndrome fucks my brain and idk. I REEEEALLLLY question every aspect of life and I can't help it. Each time I am left with questions that completely make me hate the way this world is. I guess I can give one example. The most recent self-philosophical argument I had is the idea of wars, with murdering others specifically. We praise those who fight for our country, yet at the same time a great deal of these same people are super religious. Do people not evaluate the reality they are in? Do they not question why they believe the things they do? Am I the only one? Does someone's act of ending another life provide justification for doing the same? Who is to even say so? If they would kill all of us if we did not kill them, then what makes our lives worth more? That's just one example, but then I look at areas like American healthcare or the fact my family and others are wealthy while there are people fucking dying because they cannot get water or food. Even the American political system with the deep state and shit. Why are we even on this damn earth? Seriously, what is the point of everything in life? I simply don't view the joys of life being worth living for. I just don't understand. This whole text here is just me rambling my thoughts in hopes that someone somewhere reading this could maybe help me."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits a clear and profound sense of emotional distress and hopelessness. The poster expresses a longing for the past when they felt happier and less burdened. They describe a desire to be alone and isolated, and a deep dissatisfaction with the world and themselves. The mention of deleting all social media and wishing they were never born highlight feelings of alienation and self-hatred. The poster also questions the purpose of life and expresses a lack of understanding or appreciation for the joys of life. Overall, the post demonstrates a very severe and pervasive depression that is characterized by deep emotional pain, existential questioning, and a lack of hope or enjoyment."
"Post: Advice for getting back in touch with everyday life? I think the hardest thing for me, and the largest factor I need to address to try and feel healthy again, is simply trying to feel engaged in and enjoying the present. Right now, days have little to no meaning at all, and I am only really able to think of my life in terms of weeks, months, and years. As a result of that, I feel nothing from the hobbies or moments that would before provide me feelings of joy, satisfaction or just generally fulfilling myself. The only activities I really ""enjoy"" anymore is anything that provides me with a complete escape from reality, however these activities are not exactly one belonging to a healthy lifestyle. I just want to enjoy the things that I used to enjoy, but whenever I try I feel like I am wasting my time, are not doing them well enough. Has anybody gone through something similar, and has advice for how they managed to get through it? Thanks for reading."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of disengagement and difficulty finding enjoyment in everyday life. The poster describes feeling disconnected from the present and only being able to think in terms of larger time frames. They express a lack of fulfillment from hobbies and activities that usually bring joy and mention resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms for temporary escape from reality.

The overall tone suggests a struggle with finding meaning and fulfillment in life, aligning with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Having a really bad stretch of days.. Hi all, I know this sub moves kinda fast but I just wanted to vent, hopefully some of you read this.. So my story is that I've had depression and social anxiety for about 15 years or so (at least that's when I recall starting to feel ""off"".. I'm 29 now).. Because of my poor decision to bottle things up and accept that I'm unhappy I put off seeking help until about a month or two ago in which I started going to therapy. It had taken a rather bad mental fallout that occurred in early December for me to finally reach out for help. In my sessions we've been working on techniques to combat both my SA and depression, these include going to places alone such as coffee shops, yoga classes, shopping malls, etc. (Keep in mind I have ""functioning"" social anxiety where I can physically be around people but I'm extremely uncomfortable the entire time and have a very difficult time interacting with people).. The thought process being that my depression stems from loneliness and my SA contributes to that.. It's been a big step for me to try and go out on my own, but I've been doing it almost every day even though it doesn't seem to be creating any improvement. Unfortunately the last few days have been incredibly difficult, I'm getting a very sick feeling of hopelessness and worry that my life is now just constantly shuffling around desperately trying to find something in the world that will ""fix"" me. I tried to sit at home last night to give myself a break and I couldn't even do that, I started becoming consumed by those bad thoughts and began having a panic attack.. So I decided to just go drive aimlessly even though we were in the middle of a snow storm.. I feel miserable again today and I'm just running out of steam to keep going, I really don't know what to do anymore.. I'm exhausted from constantly forcing myself into uncomfortable public situations but at the same time my home feels like a prison.. I have nobody to talk to or gain support from anymore, the couple of friends that I have all have their own lives with wives and kids and my family has been out of my life for 10 years and for good reason.. I know nobody has answers as to what I should do but I just needed to rant"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, and despair. The poster details their long-standing struggle with depression and social anxiety, which they state has lasted for about 15 years. They express a willingness to seek help through therapy, but also describe the difficulty in implementing the recommended techniques to combat their social anxiety and loneliness. The mention of feeling constantly shuffling around desperately for something that will ""fix"" them and the use of words like ""miserable,"" ""exhausted,"" and ""running out of steam"" highlight a profound emotional distress. The lack of support from friends and family further exacerbates their feelings of isolation. Overall, the post exhibits many symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression, such as chronic sadness, hopelessness, and difficulty finding enjoyment or relief from daily activities."
"Post: I dont understand how people can be so interested in so many things First, let me apologize for formatting issues, I am typing this on mobile. I generally find television boring, have little to no interest in Netflix shows, anime, and most video games and hobbies. I really only have one hobby that I have feel attachment to, and frankly, I dont enjoy most new shows. If I watch something of my own, its typically something I watched from when I was younger, like scooby doo or Phineas and ferb as the two main ones, being my absolute favorites from my youth, though that's rare as it is. And whenever I do those things, except for my one main hobby sometimes, I feel that I am all to aware that it's just escapism, and instead of escaping, I fall back into the same track. I don't think I have a short attention span, but that's what I always feel like I go back to in the back of my head, as that's what people my age are supposed to have because of this digital age."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a lack of interest and enjoyment in various hobbies and forms of entertainment, which can be indicative of anhedonia, a prominent symptom of depression.

"Post: Even if you hate them, theres something gut wrenching about hearing parents fight. I hate both of my parents. They are mentally abusive to me, and just a lack of care most of my life. Even so, listening to them fight right now makes me really uncomfortable. You'd think my hate would just make me careless about it but its just not"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

I know there are people who go much longer without finding anyone special but I really hope that doesn't happen to me. I've spent so long being someone I'm not, and now I don't know how to actually be myself anymore. I feel so depersonalized and isolated. I need someone to tell me it's ok. I have so many deep problems and I cant talk about them. I don't want sex, I want someone who can hold me and reassure me that I don't need to die to feel at peace. I just want to cuddle and talk, is that too much to ask?? I don't even care who, man woman other I dont care and still I cant fucking find anyone. I can't even find real friends.

"Post: Anxiety and Depression make you contradict and lose yourself I've had enough. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for months and the whole situation is fucking my mind up. I know I should face my problems but I don't want to and that amplifies my anxiety. I just wish people ignored me and yet I feel lonely. I don't want to be hurt and yet I am the one hurting myself. There is so many things I'd like to do but in the end I end up wasting time on the bed. There is many things I want and yet I can't bring myself to work and get them. If I oversleep I feel like shit, If I sleep too little I feel like shit. I've talked about my situation with my family and they are trying to support me (I'll start therapy in September) but I can't help feeling like a burden... My motto has always been ""The truth is in the middle"" but I've completely lost any direction and orientation.

"Post: How much longer can I fake it? I'm 33, had a full-time job for several years and have a young son. I took a leave from work in 2014 for mental illness, at which point I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, prescribed Zoloft and was back at work when my short term disability ran out. This was the first time I'd been on anti-depressants. I felt tired all the time, had no sex drive, and started gaining weight, but at least I was functional. Over the next year, I received a few verbal warnings and 1 written warning at work about my poor performance. Eventually, the mask broke and I was on leave again in 2015. This time I was away for much longer, was diagnosed w/ dysthymia, tried several different medications, found out that just about every SSRI gave me horrible side effects (sweating, nausea, insomnia, no sex drive, I'm actually thinking now that maybe they caused serotonin syndrome) and eventually landed on Remeron and Wellbutrin. This combo actually started to work, without any side effects (except for weight gain, which I've been managing with a diet now). This time, I returned to work because I received notice in the mail that my employment was going to be terminated because it was coming up on 2 years without being at work. I figured if I was going to be fired for not returning, I may as well return, make some money and worst thing that happens is I get fired anyways. I was not better when I returned to work, I was functional, I was able to smile, but the low mood persisted in a big way. And so here I am, still working, trying to fake it everyday, feeling like a house of cards thats ready to topple. I'm afraid because if I go off work again that will have been 3 leaves of absence, and I really don't think I could show my face around here anymore after that. I remember how horrible my life felt when I was on medical leave. I remember falling behind on child support, having to borrow money from my parents. I remember trying to convince my girlfriend that my low sex drive was because of meds and not because of her. I remember trying to convince an insurance company that I'm sick, while simultaneously trying to convince myself that I can get better. I remember feeling like a useless waste of skin that drained on the resources of everyone that dared to care about me. I guess what I'm saying is I know, right now, I'm suffering from depression, and I'm afraid of what might happen if I admit that again."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several strong emotional indicators of depression. The poster describes a long history of struggling with mental illness, including being diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, taking medication, and experiencing side effects.
