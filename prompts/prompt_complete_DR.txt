Example data:
"Post: Why do I feel this? I've been suicidal and depressed for the longest time. At first I could Control it and lately it's taken over my life. It's all I think about and it's fucking hell. I've lost all emotion other than sadness and depression. I don't want to do this anymore. If this is what the rest of my life is gonna be like then I don't want to live. This is my lowest point in life. I'm so lonley and can't even keep my thoughts organized. It's a mess. Please help me.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of emotional distress, despair, and hopelessness. The poster mentions feeling suicidal and depressed for a prolonged period of time, with the recent feeling of it taking over their life. They express a loss of emotions other than sadness and depression, and a lack of desire to continue living if their life will continue this way. The mention of loneliness and difficulty organizing their thoughts further indicates the severity of their emotional state. The plea for help at the end of the post suggests a significant need for support and assistance, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Do you ever go to bed planning on losing the next few days? Im about to fire up some South Park and go to sleep. I've already planned on being useless, despondent, and out-of-touch until at least Tuesday. I will be dead to the world. I will not answer your calls/texts. I will not leave my couch. I plan on hiding from everything and avoiding everyone for at least 72 hours. I'm shutting down intentionally. I'm making it a plan. Fuck you, bye.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses a strong desire to withdraw from the world, avoid social interactions, and isolate themselves for an extended period of time. The use of strong language, such as "useless," "despondent," and "shutting down intentionally," conveys a deep sense of hopelessness and despair. The overall tone of anger, frustration, and disconnection from others suggests a significant level of emotional distress commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: These ups and downs are too much for me I finally went to the dr and got a prescription for an AD but I feel like it’s worse than before. My lows are so low. My highs are just feeling normal. I’ve never seriously thought of suicide before but thoughts creep in my mind now. I can’t sleep. Constantly worried about things in my life. I have no reason to feel this way. On the outside, things are fine. Good even. I don’t dare tell my friends so they don’t worry about me. But sometimes I don’t know what to do.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of emotional instability and distress. The poster describes experiencing extreme lows and feeling worse after starting antidepressant medication. They also mention thoughts of suicide, which is a significant indicator of depression. The inability to sleep, constant worry, and feeling of having no reason to feel this way further align with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The mention of not wanting to burden friends with their problems suggests a sense of isolation and reluctance to seek support. Overall, the post exhibits strong emotional indicators of depression."
"Post: Apologizing to a family member ? Not sure if this is the right place to put this? If it’s not feel free to direct me! To sum it up, I’ve highly offended a family member of mine. I wrote this apology that I can’t bring myself to send them. I kept telling them how much I wanted to see them and I even flew up to see everyone. When we were all seated at a restaurant I was having really bad anxiety and didn’t really speak to anyone. He took this really personal and felt I came off as an asshole. I didn’t know how to explain the anxiety part of things to him so I gave him a lame excuse about eating spoiled food the night before. While it was true it wasn’t the reason I wasn’t speaking to anyone. Then I had went to his house to try and speak to him as I was leaving the next day and he told me not to come. I did anyway and you can imagine that didn’t end well at all. He won’t talk to me. I finally found the courage to type up this apology. It explains the conditions I suffer from, how they’re debilitating and the trauma I endured that caused them. The apology I feel is oversharing but I also wanted to explain myself in full and be as genuine as I possibly can. Nobody knows the things I went through but I’m going to post the apology here for you guys to read for yourselves. Please don’t judge me too harshly I just don’t want this family member to never talk to me again. I understand it may come off as a pity me type of thing but I promise it’s not. Here it is : I just wanted to let you how sorry I am. I should’ve apologized sooner but I wanted to give you time. I’d like to fully explain myself. This is really long but it’s genuine. And I’m not justifying myself in any way as I fully understand that I’ve crossed boundaries and disrespected you but I also want you to have a better understanding of what really happened. Hear me out before you roll your eyes at what I’m about to say. Some of this won’t make any sense initially. But trust me it all ties together. Whatever decision you make I’d prefer for you not to tell anyone any of this stuff. This is why I handled certain things the way I did. I’ve been through a lot of trauma. Initially it was with Savannah’s dad. He would beat me, kick me, slap, choke, etc told me my mother would be happy with me gone. And she was aware and didn’t do anything. This was when Jody had custody of me but I was visiting them when they had an apartment together. Eventually I went to live with my dad and his parents. His mom didn’t want any more kids and she was absolutely terrible to me. She’d give me Valium to sedate me, swing pots and pans at me, threaten me with knives, lock me out of the house etc. My dad wasn’t any better as he gave me my first black eye. School was really difficult as I’d get bullied pretty bad and I’d get myself suspended just to avoid it. At this point people claimed I had a behavioral issue and I was put on multiple medications I didn’t need. His mom was able to collect SSI because of this and when Jody found this out she wanted me back. After a year back and forth to court she won custody in January 2014. I was 15 at this point. She promised me a better life but it only got worse. She kept me locked up in the house for 4 years as she didn’t want me improving and losing the SSI. Her boyfriend also lived there, he was an alcoholic. He’d break into my room in the middle of the night to beat and rape me. Taunt me about how I’ve made previous suicide attempts and would go on about how he’d kill me but he figured I’d do it myself anyway. I’ve never told anyone as I figured nobody would ever believe me. Anyway, I was diagnosed with depression, PTSD, Panic Disorder, and social anxiety, and yet most people aren’t aware of a lot of the things I’m telling you right now. Because of some of these conditions it’s hard for me to socialize with people for the first time. I wasn’t trying to be distant or cold to you in person but my anxiety makes me seem that way and I’m sorry. It’s something I’m trying to work on. In fact it was so bad at one point I wasn’t even able to eat in a restaurant. I couldn’t open the door if I ordered food. I was constantly living in fear of being injured, killed, judged, any situation I was faced with I’d think of the worst possible scenario. It’s even preventing me from getting a license. Now, when you said I was chatty in text and not in person it really hurt my feelings and I wanted to explain but how do I explain this to somebody? If I just said oh I have anxiety I felt as if it would’ve sounded like bs. And I just felt absolutely terrible and I acted on an impulse and I just ended up disrespecting you and crossed boundaries I never should’ve in the first place and I am so so sorry for that. Some of the things Aunt Connie said to me I took it to heart when I shouldn’t have and it was another contributing factor as to why I had left. The spoiled meat story was true it wasn’t a lie. I ate it around 1 in the morning she didn’t give it to me I wasn’t","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","no. Reasoning: The post displays several indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes feeling highly anxious, having difficulty speaking to others, and experiencing feelings of guilt and shame. They express a deep sense of loneliness and desire for a supportive family dynamic. The mention of trauma, including physical and sexual abuse, suggests a history of significant emotional distress. The poster also mentions being diagnosed with multiple mental health conditions, including depression, PTSD, panic disorder, and social anxiety. They describe feeling broken as a person and having thoughts of ending their life. The overall tone of the post reflects a profound level of emotional pain, hopelessness, and desperation for understanding and forgiveness. These symptoms align with the symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: I am overwhelmed by guilt over my boyfriend's sexual assault of my once-best friend. My boyfriend of 2 years and I both suffer from mental health issues and trauma. I found out somewhat recently that months ago, when my then-best friend was sleeping over we were both asleep in the bed and he touched her sexually. Apparently he was stoned and thought he might start a threesome (it was casually mentioned as a possibility earlier). I know what he did was horrible. It makes me sick to my stomach to think that I was there and couldn't help. It makes me throw up and stay up at night knowing that I stayed with him. On the other hand, he himself is absolutely sick with guilt. He's been having non-stop anxiety attacks, crying spells, and moments of catatonia and he can't stop saying how horrible it was that he did that and how he wants to be a good person. I believe he is genuine and my first reaction is to make sure he gets treatment so nothing close to that ever happens again. He checked himself into a psychiatric ward last night. I'm also so overwhelmed by guilt by how selfish my internal response has been. He has cheated on me before multiple times, and I can't help but ruminate on how if I were prettier this wouldn't have happened and how it effects me. One recent (smaller) time just happened and I've had to take care of his emotions while being angry about this main terrible incident and that one. Furthermore, I'm selfishly worried about how badly this is affecting me. One of the few (maybe only?) things going right in my life is school and this is affecting me so negatively in my inability to concentrate or motivate myself. I'm also upset by how critical others have been of me in this even though they are at least partially justified. He posted his story to Reddit and got mostly cautious support. I posted mine and got a lot of messages calling me a pervert, an enabler, a shitposter, and a terrible person. He told his parents and one of the things they said was "all three of you made mistakes". Unrelated, but last night he posted a photo of us in the ER and a girl who hates me replied "ew you're back with her? Nonono what are you doing." I have no idea what I've done to make everyone in my life hate me this much. I don't have anyone left and I'm scared to lose the one person that has stuck around so far.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of depression. The poster expresses overwhelming guilt, feelings of self-blame, and a profound sense of responsibility for the traumatic incident involving their boyfriend and once-best friend. They describe feeling sick to their stomach, experiencing sleepless nights, and being emotionally overwhelmed by the situation. The mention of their boyfriend's mental health issues and his subsequent admission to a psychiatric ward adds an additional layer of distress and responsibility. The poster also reveals feelings of low self-worth, ruminating on their appearance, and how it may have contributed to the incident. They express difficulty concentrating and motivating themselves, which can be symptoms of depression. Furthermore, the negative reactions and criticism from others, as well as the fear of losing the one person who has stuck around, further contribute to the overall emotional distress and suggest a significant level of depression."
"Post: Drowning in a sea of sadness When will life ever get better? Everyday just seems to get worse. I struggle to find any meaning in the things I do because they all seem to be worthless. I'm already losing my will to live. The anxieties, loneliness, and insecurities are all suffocating me. I just want this suffering to end. But, somehow, I can never save myself from drowning in this sea of depression.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of sadness, hopelessness, and despair. The poster emphasizes the worsening of their daily experiences, struggles to find meaning or value in their actions, and expresses thoughts of losing their will to live.

The use of metaphors, such as drowning in a sea of depression, indicates the intensity and overwhelming nature of their emotions. Overall, the post is filled with profound emotional indicators commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: is it ever okay to stay friends with your best friend's ex? i'm sort of confused. my best friend's ex invited me to a group outing and i'm not sure if it's right. he also invited my best friend (she said no) and he acts like he has no respect to what happened between them. my best friend though is really upset although they broke up a while ago. what should i do, morally?","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","no. Reasoning: The post does not indicate that the poster suffers from depression. The emotions expressed in the post revolve around confusion and moral dilemmas regarding a friendship situation involving their best friend's ex. While there may be some underlying emotions related to the situation, such as concern for their best friend's feelings, it does not display the profound emotional distress and hopelessness commonly associated with severe depression. The focus is primarily on seeking advice and opinions on what they should do in this situation."
"Post: do naps trigger depression? can someone relate to this? like most of the time i go take a nap, ESPECIALLY in a sunny day, esp when the sun is setting and i wake up after and hour or two, i feel so lost and the loneliness is reinforced like 10 times. i feel like ive missed out on life and feel more of a failure by just sleeping. like ive wasted time. and the most depressing part is having no one to go enjoy the sunset with, or go out or do anything. its ugh","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of loneliness, feeling lost, and a reinforcement of negative emotions after taking a nap.

"Post: Girl friend pregnant (lgbt) I m a girl My girlfriend is pregnant with a male friend we used as a sperm donor. She did this 1 month after starting dating me but I stayed with her because i like her and I do like kids but now I have no feelings about this. She keeps saying I m not happy to have a baby but I m not having a baby, her and her friend are so no I m not happy, but I m not not happy. When the baby is born of course i will love and treat it like it s mine. But am I wrong for not being excited saying I m having a baby when in reality I m just the step parent.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","no. Reasoning: The post discusses a complex situation regarding the poster's girlfriend being pregnant with a sperm donor while they were only dating for a month. The poster expresses their confusion and lack of excitement about the pregnancy, as they see themselves as a step parent rather than a biological parent. While there may be some emotional challenges and confusion evident in the post, it does not display the severe emotional distress commonly associated with depression. The tone remains relatively calm and focused on the specific issue at hand, rather than expressing overwhelming feelings of despair or hopelessness."
"Post: I'm drowning I really can't breath. I'm drowning and can't see any chance of things getting better. I don't know how to open up to people. I don't know how to make things better. I've tried so many things to get myself out of this rut but I just can't. I really don't know what to do anymore I feel like i have lost all hope. I've been to a doctor before and got medication but I didn't want that to be the first solution. I guess I expected my doc to have the answer for me to get better. I didn't take the meds because the crazy side effects and again I only wanted to take them if I absolutely need them and the doc didn't even try anything else. So now I've hit a wall and I don't think it will get better. I want to die.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of emotional distress and hopelessness. The poster describes feeling like they are drowning and unable to see any chance of things improving. They express difficulty in opening up to others and feeling lost about how to make things better. The mention of trying multiple things and feeling let down by the doctor's solution suggests a prolonged struggle with their emotional state. The mention of wanting to die is a clear indication of severe depression and the presence of suicidal thoughts. The overall tone of despair, lack of hope, and the desire for death align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: There truly is no hope. For any of us. This is the bleakest truth of all. Everything is more complicated than you think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you won't know for twenty years. And you may never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce. And they say there is no fate, but there is: it's what you create. And even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are only here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born. But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never comes or it seems to but it doesn't really. And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along. Something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved. And the truth is I feel so angry, and the truth is I feel so fucking sad, and the truth is I've felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long I've been pretending I'm OK, just to get along, just for, I don't know why, maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery, because they have their own. Well, fuck everybody.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses a sense of hopelessness and despair, describing life as bleak and complicated. They mention feeling trapped by the choices they make and the potential long-term consequences. The post also conveys a deep sense of regret, longing for connection, and a yearning for something to make them feel loved and whole. The language used, with explicit mentions of anger, sadness, and hurt, suggests intense emotional distress. The tone of the post is overwhelmingly negative and filled with despair, aligning with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: Do you guys wish a different sperm hit you me mother’s egg. I think there is other sperm much more deserving of living this life than the sperm I once was.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of unworthiness and a desire to have been a different sperm that would have had a more deserving life. This kind of self-deprecating statement is indicative of low self-esteem and self-worth, which are commonly associated with depression. The post also suggests a sense of dissatisfaction with life and a belief that others are more deserving of happiness. These thoughts align with the negative cognitive patterns often experienced by individuals with depression. Overall, the post exhibits significant emotional distress and a negative outlook on oneself, indicating a potential presence of depression."
"Post: My male cousin stopped talking to me all of sudden. Let's call my cousin Bobby. My mother is the oldest daugther and my aunt (her sister, and Bobby's mother) is the youngest, with an age gap of 15 years old and even though they weren't really close (my mom moved to another province when she turned 18 and didn't came back to where we live now until she was 43, 2 years after my birth), we used to see each other at least 2 times in a week. I'm an only child while he is the youngest of 2 sons and since he's only 3 years older than me, my mom and my aunt thought it'd be nice to make us spend time together. We got close, really close and were like inseparable. But when he turned 12 or 13, he did stop talking to me, all of sudden. He doesn't say hi to me when he and his family visit us. Hell, he doesn't even look at me when I open the door. A year ago, during New Year's Eve, we were sitting in front of each other during dinner and I was staring at him because he looks really good now that he lost the acne. He noticed what I was doing so I moved my gaze to one of my cousin's baby and when I looked back at him, he avoided my gaze. I told my friends about him and they say that he must be embarrassed about something but I dunno about what or why since he never did something weird or bad to me. All of my other relatives told me he would start talking to me again when he got older and mature. But oh surprise: he is now 20 and at college, and he still doesn't talk to me and avoid my gaze.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post reveals a strong emotional impact with the sudden change in the cousin's behavior. The poster expresses feelings of confusion, hurt, and rejection, evident in their detailed recounting of their close relationship and the sudden disconnect. The lack of explanation for the cousin's behavior and the continued avoidance of interaction despite his age and maturity level indicate a significant emotional impact on the poster. While not all the symptoms highlighted in the previous example are explicitly mentioned, the emotional distress and negative impact on the poster's well-being align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: I feel worse everyday and I'm worried I'll have some type of breakdown I cry every single day, it's been 60 days. I talk about it but is like talking to noone at all. I talk all the time. My self worth used to fluctuate between "oh, i think i am good?" to "I'm trash" intermittently but lately it's just the bad one. I feel like I don't deserve happiness, love, attention. I'm worried about how long can I take this. Can I become numb at some point? This part it's just extremely painful and I don't think I can deal.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post displays several indicators of emotional distress commonly associated with depression. The poster describes feeling worse every day and expresses concern about experiencing a breakdown. The mention of crying every single day for 60 days indicates a prolonged period of emotional pain. The poster also discusses feelings of low self-worth, deservingness, and a lack of happiness, love, and attention. This suggests a negative self-perception and a reluctance to reach out for support. The overall tone of hopelessness, desperation, and fear, as well as the mention of feeling extremely painful and unable to cope, aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Death of biological grandfather I never got to meet This was 1/4 of my biological make up that I never met and don't know anything about. Found out he died today from my mom. Not sure what to think. Would love to hear similar stories or experiences or thoughts on this. How much of him is in me that I will never understand?","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","no. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of curiosity and desire for understanding about the poster's deceased biological grandfather whom they never got to meet. While there is a slight touch of sadness and confusion, it does not exhibit the intense emotional pain and hopelessness typically associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post is more reflective and open to hearing others' stories and thoughts, rather than expressing a deep emotional distress."
