Example data:
"Post: Toddler learning videos on youtube. Sometimes, we take long commutes in the car with our toddler. Especially, when one parent is driving we let the little one watch videos on the iPad as to not become a distraction for the driving parent. We got one of those iPad holders for the neck support. Now I'm on the search for good toddler learning videos. We have some good ones in our native language, but we need some in English as well. I'd really appreciate if you linked some of your best toddler videos for one year olds. A big thank you!","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. It focuses on a specific topic, which is finding toddler learning videos for a long commute with a toddler. The tone of the post is practical and seeking recommendations, showing no signs of overwhelming emotional distress or hopelessness. The post does not reflect the deep emotional pain and lack of enjoyment typically associated with depression."
"Post: My dad's mad after game night. My family and I were playing board games two nights ago. We finished the first one which went well, it was fun. We switched to the second game that 4/6 of us had played before. After my brother finished explaining the rules my dad (who has played before) asked a really stupid question, so we thought he was joking. He then got really mad while we were answering his question, got up, and said he's not playing anymore. The next day we didn't say anything to each other. Today, we still haven't said anything to each other and he's clearly mad. Should i say something to him or let it pass?","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. It primarily focuses on a specific issue within the family dynamic and seeks advice on how to handle the situation. While there is a mention of the father being mad and a lack of communication, there is no indication of profound hopelessness or despair. The tone of the post seems more pragmatic and seeking guidance rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress."
"Post: Losing my brother My brother died suddenly Friday night. He was 38. He was pretty much estranged from most of the family, spent some years making bad decisions and doing drugs and it caught up to him. He was trying to straighten out his life and cut out drugs and negative friends, from what I’d heard. He was in the ICU recently with heart failure and pneumonia. We talked while he was in the hospital, a lot of apologies and crying and encouragement, just a brother and sister having a conversation. The next day his blood pressure was supposedly good enough for him to be released. 10 days later, he was gone. My family members are taking it in their own ways. We all had unresolved things, a relationship we were hoping to rekindle, a bond I wanted to forge again with my big brother. He was my best friend and hero growing up. My biggest challenge as an adult. I feel so much regret and heartache over this, I can’t even begin to explain. He didn’t have an easy life. We lost a lot, he went through a lot, some of it was because of his choices, I really feel he was trying to make it right but it was just too late. We lost our grandpa and dad in the last 2 years, now my brother who was the first born grandson. I don’t think I’ll ever get over this.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses profound emotional distress and pain, with the poster describing feelings of regret, heartache, and grief over the sudden death of their brother. They feel a strong sense of loss, both in terms of their relationship with their brother and their own personal growth and development. The mention of unresolved issues and the desire to rekindle the relationship indicates a sense of longing and the impact of the loss on their overall well-being. The poster also mentions the loss of other family members in recent years, which may contribute to their emotional distress. Overall, the post displays significant symptoms of depression, including intense sadness, grief, and difficulty in finding hope or healing."
"Post: I feel worse everyday and I'm worried I'll have some type of breakdown I cry every single day, it's been 60 days. I talk about it but is like talking to noone at all. I talk all the time. My self worth used to fluctuate between "oh, i think i am good?" to "I'm trash" intermittently but lately it's just the bad one. I feel like I don't deserve happiness, love, attention. I'm worried about how long can I take this. Can I become numb at some point? This part it's just extremely painful and I don't think I can deal.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post displays several indicators of emotional distress commonly associated with depression. The poster describes feeling worse every day and expresses concern about experiencing a breakdown. The mention of crying every single day for 60 days indicates a prolonged period of emotional pain. The poster also discusses feelings of low self-worth, deservingness, and a lack of happiness, love, and attention. This suggests a negative self-perception and a reluctance to reach out for support. The overall tone of hopelessness, desperation, and fear, as well as the mention of feeling extremely painful and unable to cope, aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Best friend of 12 years seems to be drifting When we were in middle/high school we were inseparable. I thought she was the most amazing person to ever walk the planet. She made me feel so smart, beautiful, special, etc...I loved her so much. We went through everything together during those times and when college came around, we went to different schools. I had to work 2 jobs to keep my head above water and couldn't always make the 4-hour drive to see her as often as I wanted. She also got into drugs, which was no issue with me, but since I was never into it, I stopped getting invites to places with her (probably due to the fact I always was ALWAYS working.) We both drifted a bit in college, but then afterward we (and our SO's) moved to the same city. I was so excited to finally have a better schedule and see her as often as I could. I told her how I found God after struggling with depression and anxiety and she immediately accused me of being homophobic because I said I was Christian (born again I guess, we both grew up Catholic). Which was severely not the case. She also accused me of being so different that it's like she doesn't even know who I am anymore. I let her vent about the drifting and the differences we both grew into since middle/ high school, without even mentioning to her that she was different too, it's called growing and changing as you age, but I still loved her just the same...then I expressed how I don't want to lose her over this and we eventually squashed the beef. I know she doesn't like my boyfriend of 5 years all that much, mainly because she thinks he changed me, not taking into account that I can make my own decisions and have my own thoughts that that nothing to do with my boyfriend's. 2 years go by and during those two years, her father passes away unexpectedly. He was the light in her life and it was so painful to see everything she went through during that time. I was there for her as often as she needed me and then some. Eventually, things started to feel really one-sided. I kept ignoring it because I knew she was grieving, but after almost 2 years, it was starting to get to me. My calls and texts were hardly received, she always seemed to be in a rush to talk to me, it felt like walking on eggshells. I guess now, what really bothers me is that a friend of hers is going through a hard time with her SO and my best friend has been extremely supportive and just going above and beyond with this other girl, while all I feel like I've received from her is criticism of my relationship, my values, my political views (which she really knows almost nothing about but assumes my position). As I write this, I'm actually getting angry at how much I've been there for her, but how little she has been there for me. I'm extremely scared to bring all this up to her because she is so critical and everything she says cuts deep. It's not a good feeling, but neither is this. I don't really know what to do, and I can't imagine losing her. I would hope I can work up the confidence to tell her how I'm feeling and we can have a rational conversation about it. But I just feel really stuck.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","no. Reasoning: The post does exhibit some emotional distress and frustration with the relationship, but it does not reach the level of very severe depression. The poster expresses feelings of hurt, disappointment, and anger towards their best friend and describes a sense of one-sidedness in the relationship. While there is some mention of anxiety and fear of losing the friend, there is not a pervasive sense of hopelessness or despair. The tone of the post suggests a desire to address the issue and have a rational conversation rather than a deep sense of emotional pain."
"Post: I checked myself in to a Mental Hospital I decided after dealing with months of annoying suicidal ideation that I should go to a mental hospital. I say annoying because I was aware of these increased thoughts and wanted nothing to do with killing myself. While I wanted a closed environment away from home stressors to solve my issues I was also afraid of going somewhere unknown. I went through with it (despite crying and feeling emotional on the way there) to get my life turned around. I feel very often that horror stories are told of hospitals. In reality, if you need the help, please seek it out. You may have a completely different experience than someone who claims they don't remember their stay and was drugged up to their eyeballs. My experience was a pleasant one overall. I went there and focused on fixing my issues and I'd say I came out feeling better. I'm not sure if I can or should give the name of the place but I'm sure someone can let me know down below. I just want to share my experience and help people not feel so afraid of going to one. The place was pretty clean. An adult area for people 18 and over, rooms and halls split by gender. Bathrooms only seemed a bit off towards the end of the day or during the morning when people would shower. Roommates were sweet and tidy thankfully but the option to change roommates if there was a problem was always available to me. Groups were informative and engaging as well as encouraging for others to speak up if they wished. You had a good amount of personal time to do whatever. Outdoor activities were available permitting the weather. The place was meant for short stays of up to a week so anyone who's still there for longer may see the groups as too repetitive. The food was surprisingly delicious and great. Honestly expected school lunch type of food but there was variety and options for those allergic, vegetarian or needing gluten free food. There were staff members around whenever you needed them for anything. The treatment team could've been better. They were good to me but not to everyone there. Changed meds without informing me. I went from 5 to 10 to 15mg of Abilify. Good Lord I felt it once I was home. Then REALLY felt it when they made a mistake and I went cold turkey for two weeks because I couldn't get my prescription filled. I'll update once I'm properly back on it. So that's my experience. After a week, I came out feeling better. I got off of Wellbutrin after determining it could be the cause of my increased depression. The Abilify gives me energy to get up and not be stuck in bed all day. I feel better than when I went in. I know this is a long post, however I've been afraid of sharing my experience with others. I don't want to feel afraid of ashamed of having went, so here I am with this post. If this is also posted in the wrong place, please let me know and I'll gladly move it to the right subreddit.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post contains several indicators of emotional distress that align with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The poster mentions dealing with "months of annoying suicidal ideation," expressing a desire to go to a mental hospital to address their issues, and feeling fear and emotional distress about going to an unknown place. They also discuss the horror stories they've heard about mental hospitals, indicating a level of anxiety and concern. Despite this, they ultimately decide to seek help and describe their experience as a positive one overall. However, they also mention medication changes that were made without informing them, leading to negative effects once they were home. This suggests a level of vulnerability and reliance on medication for their mental well-being. The post conveys a mix of hope, fear, and vulnerability, indicating a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Someone just said “happiness is a choice” to me. What are your guys thoughts on this opinion/argument? I say it’s bullshit.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong negative reaction to the statement "happiness is a choice." The poster describes it as "bullshit," indicating a strong disagreement and a dismissive attitude towards the idea. This reaction suggests a possible lack of hope, pessimism, and a negative view of their own ability to control their emotions and well-being. While this post may not exhibit all the symptoms of very severe depression, it does suggest a potential presence of depressive thoughts and a negative mindset."
"Post: I don’t know what I’m doing anymore I feel empty, I feel bored, I feel depressed and I just want to sleep but even the thought of sleeping while there’s so much going on outside this house makes me anxious. Tomorrow I have another test and I’m skipping school again. I already skipped today because I was too lazy to start studying before Sunday and of course I didn’t know shit, so instead of taking responsibility I just skipped school. And I’m skipping again tomorrow because I studied even less for this test. My grandpa, the father of my mother, is risking death in an hospital bed. My mother is with him in the hospital everyday and every night to keep him company in his last moments of his life and she cries everyday. It hurts me so see her suffering so much. And it hurts me to see my grandpa in such critical conditions. I feel like they’re both miserable but I don’t know how to help. I wanna hang out with my friends to get rid of all these bad thoughts but I don’t have many, and if I ask them right now they’ll just answer “sorry, we can’t hang out, we have to study”. Which is true, I know it is because I should study, too. But I don’t. I just spend my days staying at home, listening to music and crying because I’m a pathetic piece of shit. I hate my life. There’s so much monotony in everything. I wanna try new things. I wanna make new friends. I wanna visit new places. I wanna become a new person. But I don’t know how to do it. Sorry for this mess... English is not my first language.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post displays strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses feelings of emptiness, boredom, and depression, along with a desire to sleep and avoid responsibilities. They also mention anxiety about sleeping while there is activity outside the house. The poster shares their reasons for skipping school, which includes feeling lazy and unprepared for tests. They express distress over their grandpa's critical condition and their mother's suffering, while feeling helpless in providing support. The poster also mentions feeling alone and wanting to hang out with friends, but believes they will decline due to studying. They express self-loathing and describe themselves as a "pathetic piece of shit." The overall tone of the post is filled with despair, hopelessness, and a desire for change that they feel incapable of achieving. These emotions align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: Inducing a natural coma This is a very serious question.Id like to induce a coma of at least 3 months on myself. People who are giving me the ‘not possible’ or ‘only medically induced’ answer. Tks but no tks.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a desire to induce a coma, which is a highly distressing and extreme measure to find relief from emotional pain. This suggests a profound level of emotional distress and desperation. The dismissive response to alternative suggestions, such as medically induced comas, indicates a lack of hope or belief in alternative options, further emphasizing the severity of the emotional distress. The overall tone of the post and the desire for such extreme measures align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: struggling to plug back in throwaway. anyway. i feel incredibly distant from everything. i feel like everyone is at the party, laughing and having a good time, and i'm stood outside watching. everyone just seems to be able to connect to one another. people seem to feel what i don't. i've gone through a tough part of life recently, and i feel nothing about it. i feel like i'm too analytical and critical. everything i look at, it's fake. cheap. nothing complicated. just crap. everything just feels fake. i went to the doctors about this. they gave me sertaline. it made me feel really shitty in the morning. and made me suicidal. they then put me citalopram. that just felt like nothing. no differences. i never feel really happy. am i doing something wrong? am i to be like this forever? why would i continue if this were the case?","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post describes a deep sense of disconnection and alienation from others, feeling like an outsider watching everyone else enjoy themselves. The poster expresses feelings of emptiness and apathy, describing everything as fake and meaningless. They mention going through a tough part of life recently, but feeling nothing about it, indicating a lack of emotional response. The mention of being prescribed antidepressant medications and not experiencing any significant changes in their mood or happiness suggests a possible lack of response to treatment. The questions about whether they are doing something wrong and if they will be like this forever, as well as contemplating why they should continue, reflect a sense of hopelessness and potential suicidal ideation. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: I think I'm having a nervous breakdown I've struggled off and on for about 10 years with anxiety and depression. The latter half has been mostly on. Recently my psychiatrist changed my medication from Zoloft to Effexor because the Zoloft had pretty much plateaued and then started working less. I don't think the Effexor is having a very good effect on me. My depression has been worse than ever. On top of that I found out that my dog has bone cancer and likely won't live more than 8-12 months. She's only 6 and she has been my entire world since I adopted her and she has helped me through a lot of difficult times. Because of these things my moods have been very bad, and I had to leave work a few days ago and I haven't been back since, and I'm pretty sure they're going to fire me because I'm still new. Although the job was adding to my stress because they failed to tell me that we would be working mandatory overtime EVERY SINGLE DAY. I don't have much of a support system. My mom is pissed at me about work, and I'm living with my grandfather who just doesn't get it. I don't really have much in the way of friends which is I guess why I'm ranting on Reddit looking for some kind of support. I don't really know what to do. I'm going to call my psychiatrist Monday to set up an appointment and hopefully get off Effexor. I want to find a job that is less intense than this one, and less hours. Hopefully part time. I don't know I just need some support/advice/anything.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes struggling with anxiety and depression for a significant period of time and mentions that their depression has worsened after a medication change. This suggests a chronic pattern of emotional distress. The mention of their dog's diagnosis of bone cancer and the emotional connection they have with their pet highlights the possibility of a major loss and adds to their emotional burden. The poster also expresses feelings of hopelessness, bad moods, and difficulty in functioning at work, which may indicate a significant impairment in their daily life. Their lack of a strong support system and the need to seek support from strangers on Reddit further emphasizes their emotional distress. Overall, the post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain, desperation, and a desire for support and advice, aligning with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: 8am. Dishes done. Laundry going. Animals taken care of. Fuck you depression. At least I've accomplished a few things today... If you're reading this, set your phone down or turn the pc off, count down from 5 and get up. Do ONE thing that you know needs to be done and smile knowing you're Doing it.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of frustration and anger towards depression, indicating that the poster is struggling with the condition. They mention completing tasks such as doing the dishes, laundry, and taking care of animals, which may seem like small accomplishments to others but are significant in the context of depression. The mention of counting down from 5 and encouraging others to take action suggests a need for motivation and a reminder to engage in basic activities. The overall tone of the post indicates a battle with depression and a desire to find moments of achievement and positivity despite the challenges faced."
"Post: Well i think i am good now After a long time with depression (3-4 years) i can say that i am feeling good.i feel that way 4-5 months now but i wasnt sure. My therapist helped me a lot (still visiting her) and my ex-friend but now girlfriend too (even if we have fights often i know at the end that she cares about me). Last september i was ready to suicide i didnt like anything not even smoke weed like i usually do or play video games. I was lying in bed/couch crying all the time and complain that i dont have future and i will be forever alone.Thank god back then my family and my dog(ye my dog,was one of reasons that i didnd hurt myself) helped me a lot.Now i have dreams again i am looking for job i am planning with my girlfriend to move to north europe and ofc i am smiling more than before. I know that i am still depressed i am not healed 100% but i know i am in the correct way. I wanted to share cause i feel really happy and who knows maybe will encourage some people here.Hope!!","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates a history of depression lasting for 3-4 years and describes a significant improvement in the poster's current state. They attribute this improvement to the help of their therapist and their now-girlfriend, who they acknowledge has conflicts with but ultimately cares for them. The mention of contemplating suicide, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, constant crying, and feelings of hopelessness in the past strongly indicate the presence of depression. The statement that they are not healed 100% suggests that they still experience depressive symptoms, but the overall tone of the post conveys a sense of hope and optimism, which is a positive sign."
"Post: Why does my mom keep talking to me? She says Im not nice like I used to be. She was like the older I get the more understanding i should be. She also feels like I should seek wealth. But that's not something I want. I want personal growth and wisdom and strength. I know a lot may disagree and say money is what matters. Yes it does. But it's a tool. Also, I do dislike my mother because she messed up my head as I grew up. She always told me her issues. Parents should never tell kids their issues. I am 22 now and she feels like she can still change the way I am. But in my opinion, the first three years is what shapes most of a person. I want to move out. I want to buy a bike, a tent and a sleeping bag and leave... what do you guys think?","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","no. Reasoning: The post displays some level of emotional distress and dissatisfaction with the poster's relationship with their mother. They express feeling misunderstood and pressured to seek wealth when their personal goals are focused on personal growth, wisdom, and strength. They also express resentment towards their mother for sharing her issues with them during their upbringing. However, these emotions do not reach the level of profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post seems more focused on seeking validation and advice regarding their desire to move out and start a new journey, rather than expressing overwhelming emotional pain."
"Post: I feel like I haven’t done a good enough job of enjoying my childhood. As someone who recently turned 18, I feel like I’ve started the next part of my life and given my childhood a finite end. I wish I wasn’t like that but I just feel less and less connected to the kid I was as every day passes. What’s the worst is that I feel like I might’ve missed the best part of my life and wasted my one shot to enjoy it as much as I could. Idk I really just want to hear from actual adults who have gone through something similar and know how to keep in touch with their child side. ❤️","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a feeling of regret and sadness about not fully enjoying their childhood. The poster indicates that they feel disconnected from their past self and worry that they have missed out on the best part of their life. This sense of missed opportunities and longing for the past can be indicative of depressive symptoms, as it reflects a negative outlook on life and a lack of fulfillment. The request for advice from adults who have gone through something similar suggests a desire for guidance and support in dealing with these emotions. Overall, the post conveys a sense of sadness, regret, and a struggle to find happiness, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
