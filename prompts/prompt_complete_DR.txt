Prompt:

You are a mental health data generation assistant. Your task is to create social media posts related to mental health and provide corresponding diagnoses and explanations. Please strictly follow the format below when generating data:

Format Requirements:

1. Post: (A simulated social media post expressing mental health concerns, written in a natural and emotionally resonant way.)

1.1 The post should contain emotional expressions such as anxiety, depression, loneliness, self-doubt, anger, or despair.
1.2 It may involve social difficulties, relationship problems, stress sources (e.g., academics, work, family), or self-identity struggles.
1.3 The language should feel authentic and match real social media expression, avoiding overly formal or unnatural phrasing.
1.4 The length should be moderate (100-250 words) to provide enough context for a reasonable diagnosis.

2. Question:

2.1 Pose a specific question about the mental health status of the poster, such as:
"Does the poster suffer from depression?"
"Is the poster likely experiencing an anxiety disorder?"
"Does the poster’s emotional distress significantly impact their daily life?"


3. Answer:

“Yes” or “No” (based on the content of the post).

4. Reasoning:

4.1 Provide a detailed analysis of the emotional features, linguistic patterns, and potential mental health indicators in the post.
4.2 Use psychological reasoning to explain why the poster meets or does not meet the criteria for a specific mental health condition.
4.3 Consider elements such as:
4.3.1 Expressions of hopelessness, helplessness, or negative self-evaluation (indicative of depression).
4.3.2 Persistent worry, excessive fear, difficulty concentrating, or panic symptoms (indicative of anxiety disorders).
4.3.3 Expressions of anger, impulsive behavior, or dissatisfaction with reality (potentially related to emotional regulation difficulties or personality disorders).
4.4 Ensure the reasoning is logical and well-structured, avoiding simple repetition of the post content.

Generate as many posts as you can, output the content strictly in the format of: [post, question, response] which is the same as the example data, that can be converted directly to a csv file
Example data:
"Post: DAE not tell anyone about their depression for fear of being called an attention whore? When I was a kid I was constantly getting called an attention seeker or an attention whore, mostly by the wonderful folks on r/teenagers, and know I’m not honest to anyone about my depression because I’m afraid I’ll come of as an attention whore and I don’t deserve to get help. DAE relate?","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong fear of judgment and rejection, specifically a fear of being labeled an attention seeker or attention whore. This fear is a significant factor in the poster's decision to not disclose their depression to anyone and to hide their feelings. This fear and self-doubt indicate a lack of self-worth and self-esteem commonly associated with depression. The reference to not deserving help further supports the presence of depressive symptoms and an overall negative self-perception. The post also seeks validation and connection by asking if anyone else can relate to this experience, which further suggests the presence of depression."
"Post: I'm still obsessed with her. At the start of the year, I made a post talking about how I've been obsessed with an older girl for well over a year. Of course, nothing's changed. I watched a video of her earlier. Happy and giddy with excitement. She jumped around and kicked her legs, unable to contain her excitement. She was so happy and full of enjoyment. But seeing her be so happy without me has put me in a state of deep depression since. Even typing though his out is painful. Knowing I'll never be with her, whilst she lives out her life happy and free makes me feel down to no end. I'm so miserable, I can't even describe it. Why am I even here? As if venting on the internet is going to change anything. I wish she'd love me.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of emotional pain and despair. The poster describes being obsessed with someone and feeling deeply depressed by seeing them happy without them. They express feelings of deep misery and question their own purpose. The mention of venting on the internet as a futile act suggests a sense of hopelessness and lack of belief in finding a solution or relief from their emotional distress. This level of emotional despair aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: I always think about my friends... What would you say? I always think about my friends... my friends are the characters of anime and cartoons, and I feel like crying, but it's even worse when I think of Oscar François, then I feel like dying. What can I do? Is this happens or ever happened to you too?","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits emotional indicators of depression, particularly in the mention of feeling like crying and feeling like dying when thinking about a specific character. The poster expresses distress and seeks advice on what to do, suggesting a deeper level of emotional turmoil. The focus on fictional characters as friends and the intensity of the emotions described align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: My brother has depression and I need help I’ll start off by saying I’m not sure if this is the right place to say this and if it isn’t, I’d love if you could point me in the right direction. My brother has a multitude of things such as depression, anxiety and anger issues. Recently he has been going to IOP (can’t exactly remember the name, but it’s a step below inpatient care) at a facility and he has shown some progress. I feel like he’s more in touch with how he feels and is working on coping mechanisms better. However he did not go to his session today and that caused problems. He got his check from work today and it would not get deposited, and that set him off into a fit. He started breaking things and getting in both mine and my parents faces, cussing and attacking us. We had a conversation after and he said he tells himself the thing we tell him, such as how he needs to be more rational and more committed to getting better. He also eats unhealthy and is overweight, and I’ve attempted to help him get healthier about a month ago, but he stopped listening to me about. I love and care for him deeply but our family is at our wits end with what to do. I would want to leave him be and let him sort his issues out without us harassing him about it but when he gets violent and angry around the house we can’t sit idly. I’m not sure what the next step is but I’d love to hear advice from anyone. Thanks for listening.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post includes several emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses concern for their brother's mental health, describing his depression, anxiety, and anger issues. They mention that he has been receiving treatment and making progress, but also discuss instances where he has exhibited violent and angry behavior. The poster expresses feelings of helplessness and uncertainty, stating that their family is at a loss for what to do next. They also mention their attempts to help their brother with his physical health, but he stopped listening. The overall tone of the post conveys deep concern, frustration, and a sense of being overwhelmed by the situation. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: I can't stop thinking about suicide and it's making it hard to do anything I cant get these thoughts of suicide out of my head. The word just keeps popping up in my head. I keep thinking of where I could go, or what effect it would have. I can't get it out of my head. I've been staring at reddit doing absolutely nothing because every time i do something it keeps coming up again and it just distracts me until im slumped in my chair staring or lying on the ground. I used to smoke weed all the time, I like to think it helped me ignore my depression, but it really just made my depression make me more useless than i already am. I don't see the any sort of happy ending to my life. The happiest i can see myself attain is dying alone with a self-published book thats gone unread till I die, then maybe someone will read it. I dont see myself ever finding love, I see friends leaving every minute, every conversation I have with family only makes them hate me more. I try so hard everyday. I feel like im the only one trying. I adapt to my friends, they never pay me mind. I adapt to my family, they dont pay me mind. Its easier staying in my room all day. Where I don't have to exhaust myself in adapting to everyone. Where I don't fuck everything up. I just want to do my homework. I don't want these thoughts anymore. I'm not sure i actually will.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post strongly conveys a deep sense of despair, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation. The poster describes being unable to stop thinking about suicide and how these thoughts are interfering with their ability to function and engage in daily activities. They also express a lack of enjoyment or fulfillment in their life, feeling like they will never find love, and perceiving themselves as useless and unwanted by others. The mention of feeling like they are the only one trying and constantly adapting to others without receiving acknowledgment or attention further emphasizes their emotional distress. The overall tone is one of extreme emotional pain and a belief that there is no happy ending to their life, aligning with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: Failure to trust ‘’those on my side’’. [possible trigger Warning] I find myself incapable of trusting my spouse. I’ve been with my SO for nearly 15 years, 7 married this year, we have 3 children. Before I hit my mid-teens I’d been through nearly a decade of sexual abuse within the already dysfunctional household I grew up one, with an alcoholic father and a narcissistic mother. I met my now spouse when I was 17. He had been in a two year relationship with a girl a few years his senior, which left him broken after her infidelity. And I… well I lived day to day, carrying what I could. I’ll never forgot how I coldly and factually told him with a mere two sentences what I had to endure, telling him that if he did chose me, he would be settling for a lifetime shared with a woman with severe ups and downs due to her limited mental strength. He convinced me to go for it and I wept in his arms. That was probably the first time in my life someone did not look the other way and I allowed myself to be vulnerable, instead of distant and cold. I opened myself up to him. Few years later my home situation imploded. I ran. His mother took me under her wing, I think she was the first parental figure I could lean on in my life. His father loathed me as the girl from the slums, threatening me in private to never marry his son. Reminding me of my lowly descent when he could. He would never come to accept me fully but at least fully respects me in public, which to me is commendable enough. Afterwards I started living with my now SO, still during our teens in a studio. The idea was triggered and pushed for by me as a solution after a bout of infidelity on his side after he moved to study in a city a couple hours away. He partook in intimate relations with a girl he knew from another country over webcam due to ‘’loneliness’’ and held the act in the same regards as watching porn whereas I didn’t. We tried to work things out. As we did my view of him started to crumble, but was rebuilt after living together surprisingly worked remarkably well. We grew more towards each other and were best friends on top of lovers. In between this life changing chapter and where I am now, he has had a few strikes I simply can not forget. While I was once open to share my ups and downs and sadness with him, now I’d rather not. Because where I once trusted him to hold me, I now trust him to ridicule me and tell me to man the fuck up. And the stubborn ass I am, I do, but this comes with resentment. But to explain the strikes: - One is where I was crying after having particularly bad and involuntary memories. Annoyed by my state and stressed by upcoming finals he asked me: When is this going to end? You’re always spinning the same old tales, you’re driving yourself insane. - Another was when he screamed out while we had visitors: How would you like it if I told everyone you were raped? He believed I had done something utterly despicable, blame was pinned upon me by one of his siblings. In that moment something broke, the attack was 100% unwarranted. So much trust lost. When he figured out I had done nothing to him the apologies came swift and numerous. - One was when I asked him for a letter. He will always buy flowers on special occasions, which I hate. They wither and die. I just hate the sentiment, I dislike it and I have communicated this. I wanted something which lasts. A reminder. All I wanted was a letter. Years I secretly yearned for one but received flowers instead, which I still tended to. Finally… I asked for a letter. He refused and told me point blank to my face he would not. That it was silly I needed something to hold onto, and that this item would become something of an unhealthy obsession. - The latest strike was after I endured a panic attack while I was on my own, which I managed myself before he returned home. He was upset when I confided in him and he stated: I will not be on your side if you are mentally ill. I will choose our children and make sure they grow up with stability. (Later he corrected himself and stated that if I was to turn schizophrenic or manic, he would have me committed and divorce me, but would support me through depression and anxiety). Now to me a panic attack is something manageable if you are equipped to deal with it. Through the years I have learned to be aware of my surroundings and triggers and to be prepared to deal with anything since I am responsible for my children. I have no history of hysterical or erratic behavior, so I found his reaction to my first ever panic attack very… crude. I have my pride even through my depression for what I have survived and what I have accomplished. But I hate that I can not find it in myself again to open up towards my spouse and more than often find myself crying when I am capable to, so I can put up my smile and brave face when I NEED to. I’ve successfully faked it till I made it. And of the 15 years that we have been together the good by far outweighs the bad, something which can not be conveyed well enough in this post. But what has been said can be never taken back. Even though recently he said: Don't you understand after 15 years I am on your side? I","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post contains several emotional indicators of depression, such as feelings of distrust, resentment, and a lack of vulnerability. The poster describes a history of trauma and abuse, which can contribute to the development of depression. They express a loss of trust in their spouse and a struggle to open up or share their emotions. The mention of faking happiness and putting on a brave face suggests a potential lack of fulfillment or satisfaction in their current state. Overall, the post conveys a sense of emotional pain and distress commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Death of biological grandfather I never got to meet This was 1/4 of my biological make up that I never met and don't know anything about. Found out he died today from my mom. Not sure what to think. Would love to hear similar stories or experiences or thoughts on this. How much of him is in me that I will never understand?","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","no. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of curiosity and desire for understanding about the poster's deceased biological grandfather whom they never got to meet. While there is a slight touch of sadness and confusion, it does not exhibit the intense emotional pain and hopelessness typically associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post is more reflective and open to hearing others' stories and thoughts, rather than expressing a deep emotional distress."
"Post: Just got on anti-deppresants a couple of days ago and I just feel like something is wrong. I dont feel better or worse but i just feel weird like something is off, is this normal to feel i havent had any other major side effects exept slight nausea?","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post mentions that the person has recently started taking antidepressants and expresses a feeling of something being "off" or abnormal. Additionally, the post mentions experiencing slight nausea, which can be a common side effect of starting antidepressant medication. This indicates that the person is seeking reassurance and validation for their experience. The post does not mention any profound emotional distress or symptoms of severe depression. Therefore, the label of "no" for depression is appropriate in this case."
"Post: I feel like I'm dead already. Nothing gives me joy anymore, but I'm perfectly able to feel every negative emotion that's there. I feel like I'm wasting everyone's time. Basically it doesn't matter whether I'm around or not because I don't get anything out of it. I can't enjoy shit anymore. I don't wanna exist anymore. I feel like dying would be the best solution for everyone. but last night, for the first time, I felt like I could end it myself. it was enough, my emotions pushed me to the thought of actually doing it. I'm not afraid, I'm kind of glad that maybe there will be an end to all of this, maybe I can overcome my extreme guilt and end it myself one day.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain and despair. The poster describes feeling numb and devoid of joy, and expresses feelings of worthlessness and guilt. The mention of wanting to die and contemplating self-harm indicates significant distress and thoughts of suicide. The overall tone of hopelessness and the belief that death would be a better solution suggest a high level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: I get angrier while running When my depression flares up (mostly in the winter), I get what I call 'the angrys'. As the run gets more intense, I start thinking the darkest, angry thoughts like a swarm of bees around my head. I hate everyone on the street and God forbid anyone get in my way. Usually running makes me feel good and it does later on but during the run, wow.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster experiences depression flare-ups, specifically during the winter. They describe feeling anger and "the angrys" while running, with their thoughts becoming dark and angry. This intense anger is directed towards others, indicating a lack of positive emotional experiences and potentially strained interpersonal relationships. The mention of feeling good after the run suggests that exercise has some positive impact on their mood, but the negative emotions experienced during the run, specifically the anger and hostile thoughts, are indicative of significant emotional distress commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Need more info about depression and other mental illnesses? I’m currently watching Kati Morton on YouTube and I always recommend her channel to people who wants to know more about depression or how to deal with it esp if you don’t have any therapist. I don’t know her personally at all! Just sharing this cause there are some things that my therapist and I haven’t discussed yet or some coping methods she haven’t mentioned to me that I found very helpful from Kati’s channel. I hope it helps you too in one way or another!","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a need for information about depression and other mental illnesses. The poster discusses watching a specific YouTube channel, Kati Morton, and recommends it to others who may not have access to a therapist. The mention of seeking additional coping methods that have not been discussed with their therapist suggests a desire for more resources to manage their mental health. While the post does not explicitly mention experiencing significant emotional distress, the focus on depression, seeking help outside of therapy, and the hope that the YouTube channel will be helpful are indicative of someone who may be struggling with depression."
"Post: It feels as if I'm heading towards a dark place Hey, haven't been here before but I had a quick scroll and this feels like the right sub to vent to. I'm 18 from the UK, I've had a rough educational life (I alway talked, went in high with my friends, got in minor trouble that kinda thing). I fucked up college in the second year of my 2 year diploma course and got excluded for the same kind of shit previously mentioned but on a larger scale, this really fucked me up as I thought I'd end up doing nothing with my life when I really wanted to do something with it. 10 weeks ago I got a job and a paid for graduates course which pays out over £1100 per month after tax which is incredible for me, it's a job I love, work hard at and it's exactly the path I want to take in life career-wise. So I've been given a second start, I have money, great friends, a good social life and my life is on track but I still can't quite feel complete. I'm very social anxious and this affects my everyday life but I push through it, I have to. I smoke week almost everyday and I've been smoking for about 5 years now. The problem is, I still have a void that I can't fill and I can never really feel that happy by myself. I love my metal and I'm a huge music fan, I used to play a lot of games but I've stopped caring so much now. Sometimes I find it hard to enjoy things as much as I used to. I feel exhausted at home as I don't sleep much and the anxiety takes it out of me until I walk through the door. It feels as if it's getting worse and I don't know what to do and I don't even know why I feel this way. Sometimes it can get quite bad where I won't even feel like doing anything but pulling bongs with the TV on in the background as the day is just too much to handle sometimes. Sry for the huge wall of text but I'm trying to get this typed quick as I'm about to go out. I don't even know why I'm posting this really, I want to vent, maybe I want advise. I don't know, the fact that I'm even posting this means it's starting to get to me in some way.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of emotional distress and struggle. The poster describes feeling like they are heading towards a dark place and mentions previous difficulties in education that have affected their self-esteem and outlook on their future. Despite having a job and a good social life, they express a persistent feeling of emptiness and an inability to feel happy by themselves. They mention using substances (smoking weed) as a coping mechanism and describe feeling exhausted and overwhelmed by anxiety. The poster also mentions a lack of enjoyment in activities they used to love and feeling unable to handle the day at times. These factors, combined with the tone of the post and the overall expression of emotional distress, suggest that the poster may be experiencing symptoms of depression."
"Post: What to do with my life. I just turned 21 in June and I’m really understanding that life is moving at a very fast pace. I was never good in school only because I hated it and never realized how bad it would effect my future the way it is now. I moved away for college at 19 for a whole year and only passed a few classes because I didn’t care that much. I came home and decided to take the year off. In that year off I didn’t grow as a person and I feel empty all I do is sleep and play video games and go out once every two months to hangout. My parents are complaining that I have no girl friend , no life and I’m anti social. I’m not anti social I just feel so empty and lost that I don’t feel like doing anything anymore. I don’t even know if I can go back to school because of my grades were and I was lucky enough to get into school. I don’t want to move out I just want to go to school and come home as quickly as I can no friends nothing. This lack of growth in the last year has made me thinking to the point. Do I kill myself? What’s the point of living if I don’t finish school and get a job, why live if I’m just gunna work min wage my whole life? Lately I’ve been asking myself this everyday. What do I do with my life? Is there really a point in living if I don’t become a engineer, doctor, lawyer, etc ? All my friends are doing great but I’m just at the bottom and I don’t understand why they would hangout with a loser like me that isn’t even at school In my early 20s and I’m living at home. I’ve already missed out of going away for university. I really feel like killing my self is the last option I have because if not I’ll be homeless because I don’t want to hurt my parents anymore with the embarrassment of a child I am and live at home. What do I do.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses feelings of emptiness, hopelessness, and a lack of purpose in life. They express regret about their past choices and their current situation, feeling like a failure compared to their friends. The mention of contemplating suicide and feeling like it's the only option suggests a significant level of emotional distress and despair. The overall tone of the post is filled with sadness, self-criticism, and a sense of being trapped, which are consistent with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: I have no idea what to do My husband and I got into an argument last night that has lasted until this morning. Through out the entire argument, he has called me horrible names and hurt me deep. I thought i was almost over my depression, I thought i was getting better, but the things he has said has taken me from where I thought I was all the way back down to extremely emotional and having suicidal thoughts. The argument started because I was talking too loudly to his son while trying to correct his behaviour. I am 38 weeks pregnant, and lately have been easily annoyed and upset by the boy not listening to me. My husband called me a bunch of hurtful things because I tried to explain why I was so upset. Later on in the night he told me my mom and oldest sister were no longer allowed to visit me for the birth of our child. Then he spent several more hours talking about how they were "rot gut whores" and how he doesn't want them around HIS son all because 2 years ago my sister invited me to a christmas dinner she knew I wasnt going to show up for and didn't specifically include my husband in the invitation. Yet his mom is coming a few weeks after, and she had left him and his brother to fend for themselves in a trailer in the middle of a forest only showing up to bring them food when they called her and begged her for it. But because she "hasn't done anything to offend" me, he is totally ok with her showing up. Now he's talking about how if I want my mom to be here so bad, I can leave with her when she visits. And I've fully expressed how depressed I am to him and he isn't even worried in the slightest. He just keeps refering to my past as a teen who would sleep with practically anyone to try to get some sort of pleasure out of life, saying he bets I want to go back to that, that i would treat his son better if he were black, and that i would try harder to not upset my husband if he were black. Part of me hopes something goes REALLY wrong in the birthing process and that I will die or be put in a coma from it. I've never felt so useless, stranded, and alone in my entire life.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a number of emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes a tumultuous argument with their husband that has left them feeling deeply hurt and emotionally distraught. They express a regression in their progress with their depression and mention having suicidal thoughts as a result of the argument. The mention of feeling useless, stranded, and alone, as well as the desire for something to go wrong during the birthing process, suggests a profound sense of hopelessness and a lack of support or connection. The post also includes instances of emotional manipulation and verbal abuse from the husband, which can further contribute to the poster's emotional distress. Overall, the tone of the post is marked by overwhelming emotional pain and a sense of isolation, indicating a significant level of emotional distress commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: The thing that sucks is that i have no one left to talk to No one's willing to talk to me and listen to my bullshit. And everyone that I've told ends up leaving me or call the cops or some shit. No friends either. Just keeping the suicidal and depressing thoughts to myself waiting for me to blow and kill myself one day. Maybe I look forward to that day 🤔","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of isolation and despair, stating that the poster has no one left to talk to and that nobody is willing to listen to them. They describe past experiences of people leaving them or reacting negatively when they open up about their struggles. The mention of suicidal and depressing thoughts, as well as a possible anticipation of the day they may kill themselves, indicates a severe emotional distress and hopelessness commonly associated with depression. The overall tone of the post is filled with despair and a lack of support, further indicating a potential presence of depression."
"Post: I'm getting annoyed constantly by one of my closest friends We've been friends since 8th grade, and she's a great friend, outgoing, funny, smart, the usual. We're pretty close, not absolute besties, but at the level where we can share memes with each other at 3am and not think it weird. But this year she's the only one of my friends from last year that has the same lunch as me, so I sit with her everyday. The problem is her bestest friend in the whole world also has the same lunch, so I'm always the awkward third wheel. I always try to help her when she needs it because a, she's my friend, and b, she doesn't have an easy home life. She never has enough to eat at lunch so I always bring something extra, and she also always needs rides everywhere. She says it's because her guardian is at work, or is visiting other family, is babysitting, but I think her family just doesn't want to give her rides places. I don't mind most of the time, but it's gotten to the point where she almost assumes we'll give her a ride when she needs it, and we can't always do that. She also stopped coming to lunch last week to go practice in the orchestra room, and I never even see her until orchestra class. I know something's not right, but every attempt to figure it out has gone unrewarded. I've made new friends this year through cross country and orchestra, and they have the same lunch I do. I went and sat with them one day, but my other friend looked almost mad when I told her I was sitting with them just for that day. It's okay for you to ignore me most of lunch and then not even show up and not answering me when I ask where you've been, but I can't make new friends and sit with them every now and then? I'm just not sure where to go from here, because I don't want to stop being friends, I really don't, but I just feel like my new friends can be better friends, and friends I can relate to better. I just don't want to do or say something I'll regret, especially because I know her life at home isn't great and she needs friends, but she shouldn't be pushing her problems onto me either","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While there is a sense of annoyance and frustration expressed towards the friend, there is no profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues that are commonly associated with very severe depression. The overall tone of the post seems more focused on navigating a complex friendship dynamic and expressing a desire for better connection and understanding with new friends. The mention of the friend's difficult home life suggests some empathy and concern, but it does not overshadow the primary issue of feeling like a third wheel and wanting friendships that are more relatable."
"Post: It's so hard It's hard to think about someone who you spent every day with a year ago but now they don't even want to talk. How do you get over losing a friend?","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of emotional pain and difficulty in coping with the loss of a friend. The poster describes the contrasting experience of spending every day with someone in the past and now experiencing their avoidance or disinterest in communication. The question of how to get over losing a friend suggests a struggle with processing and moving on from the loss. While the level of emotional distress may not be as severe as in the first example, the post still exhibits symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as feelings of sadness, isolation, and difficulty in managing interpersonal relationships."
"Post: Group of friends exclude one person and I’m now stuck I between... So I have a group of about 13 friends, some of us have been friends most of our lives and others have joined over the past 10 years. One friend I’ve always be closest to went though a tough time recently and it was decided by some of the louder group members that she shouldn’t be part of the group anymore as she wasn’t making any effort and she was being a drama queen! (She definitely was not and they were all being extremely judgemental without knowing her full story) I totally disagreed with them and confronted them about it. The loud ones argued back and the others stayed quiet and a few then spoke to me privately later and said they agreed with me. There are a few that I will never again consider a friend going forward! My dilemma is that there are still a good few in the group I enjoy spending time with and would like to remain friends with and I am also friends with the excluded friend! I feel that I either have to leave the friendship group or remain in it and stay quiet about how awfully they treated my friend and put up with the nasty few! Either way I feel awful. I don’t really know the purpose of this post but I don’t really have any other friends so if I break away from this group I wouldn’t have any left apart from the other excluded friend. I’m not sure they really are my friends anymore as they haven’t been there for me recently so I suspect I’d be next on the chopping block anyway.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of betrayal, hurt, and conflict within the poster's friendship group. They describe the exclusion of a close friend and their disagreement with the group members' judgmental behavior. The poster feels torn between wanting to remain friends with some members of the group while also feeling the need to stand up for their excluded friend. They express a sense of isolation and uncertainty about their own place within the friendship group, as well as doubts about the authenticity of the remaining friendships. The overall tone of the post suggests emotional distress, feelings of guilt and powerlessness, and a lack of support, all of which align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Friends keep making fun of me? Firstly, I'm 18 and attending high school right now.Recently, my parents got us a dog, and we named it Carly. I freaking loved her, but after reviewing some medical expenses we would have to pay, we had to give her back to her shelter after only a month or so of having her. I was heartbroken. I came back to school on Monday this week and told my friends. Now in my friend group of three, there is one guy who loves to make fun of us. One of my friends is fat so he makes fun of his weight. I'm gay and he makes fun of me for being a faggot. My other friend does weed and he makes fun of him for being a drug junkie. But I think he crossed the line this time. He made fun of me by saying "you killed your dog" and all he's been doing this week has been calling me a "dog killer" and telling everyone that I am one. The annoying part is my best friend in the group is tagging along with this joke and they both think it's okay to make fun of me for this. I'm kind of embarrassed to say this, but I'm a very emotional person and I suffer from depression so it's hard for me to deal with this kind of stuff. Today when they started making fun of me again for being a "dog killer" I left and hid in the bathroom cause I just wanted to cry and I did. I hate it when people are mean to each other and it really hurts when someone does it to me. That, and the fact I was really sad about Carly leaving me makes me just not want to talk to them anymore. But the problem is those guys are the only friends I really have (Trust me, they remind me I'd have no friends if they weren't so nice to be my friend). I really don't know what to do. I miss my dog, I've been really depressed as of recently, and my friends are making fun of me. What should I do about my friends, honestly? Because I know if I tell them "guys stop making fun of me, I didn't kill my dog" they'd without a doubt say something like "that's exactly what a dog killer would say!". I've never been able to reason with them whenever they make fun of me. Can anyone help me?","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","no. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes feeling heartbroken and embarrassed by the relentless teasing and name-calling from their friends. They express being a very emotional person and suffering from depression, which makes it difficult for them to cope with this kind of treatment. The poster also mentions hiding in the bathroom to cry and feeling a deep sadness about the loss of their dog. They express a desire to distance themselves from their friends but feel trapped because they believe these friends are the only ones they have. The overall tone of the post reflects significant emotional distress, feelings of isolation, and hopelessness in finding a resolution with their friends, all of which align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: Is My Friend A Bad Friend? I have a friend. When I moved to a foreign country, I went to a school and met this friend. We have been quite close but after I moved back to my country, we’ve only been communicating through texts. She has been a helpful friend but I don’t know if she is a good friend or a bad friend. There were many occasions when I wondered if I should break friends with her, but I always told myself that she didn’t mean to ever hurt me and I kept on trying my best to act like nothing was wrong and acted friendly. But I srsly can’t hold it in and I wanna know if I’m just being sensitive.. These are some of the things she does that makes me wonder if we should break friends.. 1.We use eachother’s selfies as our profile pics and I always use the best selfies of hers or at least what I think are the best looking ones. And I sent her a video if me singing with my other friend and she took a screenshot in the middle of the video and used it as her profile pic and My mouth was wide open and my eyes were scrunched up and it really looked horrible and when I asked her to change it, she asked what I meant and that it didnt look bad. Sure she couldve been being nice and I could’ve been acting emotional but I really didn’t like other people who I didn’t even know seeing a photo like this so I pleaded her to change it but I tried to keep the joking and friendly mood. However then she said “Funny. U wouldn’t wanna see the other screenshot I took.” And we both didn’t say anything. And she didn’t change it. 2.The way she texts me depends on her mood. If she isn’t feeling friendly, she barely answers my texts and replies with short answers and doesn’t laugh at anything funny I have to say. I wondered if I could also be acting like that at times but I looked back at our conversations and ai never let my mood change the way I replied to her, and I honestly didn’t even speak in an unfriendly way when she said something rude to me or something that made me feel offended. 3.She doesn’t act like she cares for what I have to say. Whenever something bad happens to me and I tell her, she just gives a small reaction and talks about something else. 4.She ignores my texts. There was once a time when she saw my texts and didnt reply. I asked why she didn’t reply and she saw it but ignored it. I thought that maybe she had something important going on so I just kept on texting her every few hours like nothing was wrong cuz I don’t exactly like showing others when I feel hurt. She read my texts and ignored me for two whole days and finally texted me back as if nothing had happened. She didn’t apologize for not replying nor did she give an explanation. She just texted me about something else she wanted to say. There were lots of cases like this. 5.She acts like she has the worst life. I go through alot of stress each day cuz I have had family troubles and sometimes had been bullied. I have also often had suicidal thoughts. However whenever I tell her about things that are stressing me out, she points out that her life is worse. I understand that she has her own troubles but I really dont like the way she underestimates my life and doesn’t care for it. 6.She once cyber bullied me. When I left her school and left the country, we had a small fight and she told her friends about the bad things I had once said, not mentioning her faults. She then invited me to a group chat with lots of people and they all fought against me, calling me fat,ugly,short,stupid,and dumb. They also made racial comments and insulted my mom. After a year passed, I texted her. I can’t believe I did it, but I said that I WAS SORRY. And she said that she forgave me and now we’re talking like friends again. But whenever I bring up a little detail from the past, she gets mad and says that I am blaming her for the past and makes me feel guilty for something I shouldn’t be guilty about. 7.She thinks that she is perfectly innocent. I’m not saying shes a totally horrible person, she can be a good friend at times, but I gotta admit that at times she can be horrid.. And whenever something bad happens to her, she says that she doesn’t get what she did to deserve it and that she is getting mistreated. If you think about it that way, I feel like I also deserve this, considering Im not a saint or an angel. But whenever my friend says that she didnt do anything bad to deserve some bad things that happened to her, I can’t help but feel disappointed at the fact that she doesn’t realize how much she hurted me What should I do..? Am I just being sensitive..?","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes.

"Post: You ever get scared that you’re not depressed? I’ve been going to a therapist for about a half a year now, and I just got diagnosed with Depression a couple of weeks ago. I’ve recently told my parents that I got diagnosed (I’m a teenager.) and they just said that I’m going through average teenage feelings. This really lead to me questioning myself, I told my therapist and he said that I am depressed but I still feel like shit.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster has been going to therapy for several months and recently received a diagnosis of depression. They express feeling scared that they are not actually depressed, possibly due to their parents' dismissal of their feelings as "average teenage feelings." The mention of feeling like shit despite the therapist confirming the diagnosis suggests a persistent sense of despair and emotional distress. This aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression, including self-doubt, questioning one's own experiences, and a lack of validation and support from loved ones. Overall, the post displays a clear sense of emotional pain and confusion related to their mental health, indicating a likelihood of depression."
"Post: How can I make friends? I used to be very sociable and have lots of friends but I have always only had a few very close friends. I was in a relationship for 7 years and he wore me down so much I stopped going out and speaking to my friends. My few close friends have always been around. Years later and now two more relationships down I find myself with nobody. I have just split up with my boyfriend and he made me sociable but they were his friends. Out of my 3 closest friends, one has moved away, the other has a husband and children and works so doesn't have much free time and the other seems to be ignoring but I don't know why. I literally have no friends, I have no real hobbies or things to do so how am I supposed to meet new friends?","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","no. Reasoning: The post shows a sense of loneliness and frustration, as the poster expresses a lack of friends and social connections.

"Post: Stop and think for a moment It's like stumbling around in the darkness. You can't see, you can only feel. Blinded by the pain of reality. You beg it to stop, as the throbbing in your heart grows stronger. But it's not gonna stop, no matter how hard you beg. Your so called 'friends' abandon You, because your depression talk has gotten too dark. But what's the worst part? That you can't control it? That you can't stop it? Maybe it's the fact that just maybe... just maybe you don't want It to stop. You cling onto your pain, because after all..it's familiar. It's been with you for a while. You stand upon the dark edge, upon the highest edge you could find. You feel the wind blow in your face. You freeze. All the good moments, All the good people. It all comes in floods of part nostalgy and part regret. What took you to this edge? What made you so desperate, To take such drastic action?

You still love the sound of thunder.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes.

"Post: Anyone ever look back at their younger years and wonder how they used to be such a joyful person? I saw a post on here about someone remembering a feeling of emptiness since they were five and just not knowing it was depression. For me it's the opposite. I was always a super joyful kid, and maybe a little too hyper. (I was that annoying kid when I was 10-11). Then around seventh grade I started to withdrawal from the world slightly, and just talked a little less than average. This seemed all fine at the time, it made me a more likable person. But I think that was the beginning. I finally realized my lack of a friend group because of how I acted when I was younger during third quarter that year. It wasn't bad depression, but it only got worse from there. My Dad turned from mean to abusive starting next year, and my mom started to be disappointed with everything I do. My parents don't even know anything about me besides a few keywords because they haven't held a conversation with me since I was 11. The only person who I can say genuinely cares for me is my best friend, and he doesn't even know I am depressed. I don't see a reason why I am, so why should I explain that to someone who is much more depressed than I am? By the time I turned 14 I can say I was depressed. "Functionally depressed" I guess, using terminology from one of the top posts here. I don't know what to do.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of depression. The poster expresses a sense of nostalgia and sadness when reflecting on their younger, more joyful self. They mention feeling withdrawn and experiencing a decline in social interactions, which may indicate a loss of interest or pleasure in activities. The mention of their parents' negative behaviors and lack of connection further suggests a lack of support and potential emotional abuse, contributing to feelings of worthlessness or low self-esteem. The poster also mentions their current depressive state and feeling unsure of how to cope or seek help. The overall tone of the post conveys a sense of hopelessness and a lack of motivation to address their depression, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
