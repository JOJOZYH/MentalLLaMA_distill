"Post: Why do I feel this? I've been suicidal and depressed for the longest time. At first I could Control it and lately it's taken over my life. It's all I think about and it's fucking hell. I've lost all emotion other than sadness and depression. I don't want to do this anymore. If this is what the rest of my life is gonna be like then I don't want to live. This is my lowest point in life. I'm so lonley and can't even keep my thoughts organized. It's a mess. Please help me.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of emotional distress, despair, and hopelessness. The poster mentions feeling suicidal and depressed for a prolonged period of time, with the recent feeling of it taking over their life. They express a loss of emotions other than sadness and depression, and a lack of desire to continue living if their life will continue this way. The mention of loneliness and difficulty organizing their thoughts further indicates the severity of their emotional state. The plea for help at the end of the post suggests a significant need for support and assistance, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: What is the title of my grandpa’s cousin to me. (Male) My blood related grandpa did not raise my dad, his cousin did. My grandpa’s cousin’s mother was the sister of my blood grandpa’s mother. So what is the title of the my grandpa’s cousin and how much blood relation is there?","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","no. Reasoning: The post does not show any strong emotional indicators that would suggest the poster is suffering from depression. The content is solely focused on a question regarding family relationships and blood relations. There are no expressions of emotional pain, hopelessness, or distress. The tone of the post is factual and seeking information, rather than conveying deep emotional struggles."
"Post: Looked at bank statement, saw 100 less than I expected, almost had a breakdown. Been having to eat out a lot for reasons I don't really want to get into and are really upsetting to think about. Checked my bank statement and saw that I had a hundred fewer dollars than I expected, looked at the charges, saw how much more I was eating out than I'd expected having had to, got really upset and resentful about my situation, which compounded how upset and resentful I was about "missing" the money in the first place. Really not doing good right now.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a strong emotional reaction to a financial issue. The poster describes almost having a breakdown and feeling upset and resentful about their situation. This indicates a level of emotional distress that goes beyond just being disappointed or frustrated. The mention of not wanting to get into the reasons for having to eat out suggests that there may be underlying issues or experiences that are causing additional stress and upset. The overall tone of the post, including feelings of being not "doing good" right now, aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: How do you get up and out of bed in the morning? I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit but I don't really know where to post for motivational tips or tricks. I've done everything suggested on Google searches like putting your alarm clock across the room, setting daily goals, and trying to get myself excited for the next day but I would gladly just lay in bed all day. I'm a college student majoring in Finance. I'm not the best student but honestly I only care about getting my degree. GPA means nothing more than having the requirements to walk across the stage. I am doing an internship and doing 6 hours of college classes over the summer but both can be done from home and the internship is really better suited for self-starters. Once I'm out of bed, I'm good for the most part. It's just getting out of bed that is my biggest problem. Any help would be very great.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post displays several indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses a lack of motivation and difficulty getting out of bed in the morning, which can be symptomatic of depression. They mention trying various strategies and techniques, such as putting the alarm clock across the room and setting daily goals, but still struggle with this issue. The lack of interest or passion in their college studies, stating that GPA means nothing to them and they only care about getting their degree, can be indicative of anhedonia, a symptom of depression where one loses interest or pleasure in activities they used to enjoy. The mention of doing an internship and college classes from home suggests potential social isolation, which can contribute to depressive symptoms. Overall, the post conveys a sense of helplessness and a need for external support, which aligns with the symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: Getting my BA Accomplishment in a reality that uses a perception of truth is mediocre at best. But it is an accomplishment and should be celebrated. I found a lot of like-minded individuals who only run on hope, who understand there are no absolutes.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post contains a mixture of positive and negative emotions. The poster acknowledges that getting their BA is an accomplishment that should be celebrated, which suggests some level of positive emotion and pride. However, the post also expresses a sense of disillusionment with the perception of truth in society and refers to it as mediocre. The mention of like-minded individuals who only run on hope and the understanding that there are no absolutes can also indicate a deeper level of existential questioning or dissatisfaction. Overall, while the emotional indicators are not as strong as in the first example, there are hints of negative emotions and a possible underlying dissatisfaction or disconnection from societal norms or expectations. This could align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Been independent since 17 I have been living with my girlfriend since I was 18 and 1 year a lone. It's so discouraging to see your friends live at home, go to school, and have a chance to fail or make mistakes. I resent them almost. I work 6 days a week and I can still bearly pay my bills. I don't get to mess up. If I fucked up I'm on the street or out of of the job. Everything is just toil toil toil, work, sleep, work. I just want a chance to be my age... I'm so tired...","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits a sense of discouragement, resentment, and exhaustion. The poster expresses frustration and envy towards their friends who have the opportunity to live at home, go to school, and make mistakes. This suggests a lack of fulfillment and perhaps feelings of being stuck in their current situation. The mention of working 6 days a week and struggling to pay bills highlights the financial stress and strain they are under, which can contribute to feelings of hopelessness and fatigue. Overall, the post conveys a sense of emotional distress, exhaustion, and a longing for a different lifestyle, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Aha! moment during therapy So I've been meeting with a therapist about once a week since October of 2017. It's been really great, and has helped pull me from the brink more than once. Background: I'm gay, and was raised Catholic in the 90s. Guess what happened next! Spoiler: I was bullied mercilessly. If I wasn't too gay, I was too fat, or too tall, or too weird or too unpopular. You get the gist. It it wasn't my hair, it was my mannerisms; if it wasn't my high voice, it was the dark circles under my eyes. (Gee, what could have caused me to be losing sleep?) Flash forward to today: My therapist guided me through a meditation today that instructed me to visualize and speak to a younger version of myself. I described what I looked like, what characteristics defined me, and how I saw myself. Then I was instructed to, as myself as the adult I've become, speak to that child and tell him what I was feeling. I spoke with kindness and compassion and love and respect for that child, and told him everything would be alright. I told him that all of that hatred was wrong, that it was incorrect and that those people who say all those nasty hurtful things, they probably aren't even going to remember saying it, so don't waste your time holding onto it. And it got me thinking about all of the baggage I've he'd onto my life. All the glances and side comments and nasty, hateful things. And how I've internalized it, and believed it. And that's when the Aha! moment came. *All this time, I've been so worried about all the bullying that other people did, I wasn't even thinking about all the bullying I did to myself.* https://media.giphy.com/media/12KiGLydHEdak8/giphy.gif All this time, *it was me.* Sure, it was other people who planted those seeds, but it was me who perpetuated it, who told myself that they were true. After all, if you say something enough, it might as well be as true as anything else. So there it is. There's one step. It might just be one step, but it's a step in the right direction. There's my holy shit moment of the day, and I just wanted to share with you all. There is hope. There is progress. There is love. And I hope you all are able to find it.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post displays emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes a history of being bullied and the negative impact it has had on their self-esteem and mental well-being. They express a sense of self-blame and realization that they have internalized the bullying, perpetuating negative beliefs about themselves. This indicates deep emotional distress and a lack of self-compassion. However, the post also shows a glimmer of hope and progress with the therapy session and the realization that there is the potential for healing and self-love. Overall, the post aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression, but also includes a glimmer of hope and progress towards recovery."
"Post: I'm still obsessed with her. At the start of the year, I made a post talking about how I've been obsessed with an older girl for well over a year. Of course, nothing's changed. I watched a video of her earlier. Happy and giddy with excitement. She jumped around and kicked her legs, unable to contain her excitement. She was so happy and full of enjoyment. But seeing her be so happy without me has put me in a state of deep depression since. Even typing though his out is painful. Knowing I'll never be with her, whilst she lives out her life happy and free makes me feel down to no end. I'm so miserable, I can't even describe it. Why am I even here? As if venting on the internet is going to change anything. I wish she'd love me.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of emotional pain and despair. The poster describes being obsessed with someone and feeling deeply depressed by seeing them happy without them. They express feelings of deep misery and question their own purpose. The mention of venting on the internet as a futile act suggests a sense of hopelessness and lack of belief in finding a solution or relief from their emotional distress. This level of emotional despair aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Someone told me I look like I'm on power saving mode. And that's exactly how I feel.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post uses a metaphor ("power saving mode") to express a feeling of low energy and fatigue. This aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as lack of motivation, feeling drained, and experiencing a decrease in overall energy levels. The tone of the post suggests a similarity between how the person looks and how they actually feel, indicating a deep sense of emotional exhaustion and possibly depression."
"Post: Reddit, need your help on restoring friendship Hello there, dear redditors. I truly need your advice and every opinion is highly appreciated, so feel free to express whatever's on your mind. I'll try to keep things as short as possible, so here's the problem. I know a friend of mine since we were 7 and now i'm 23. Recently (for a month or two) i started allowing new people in my life, which is pretty unusual for me and it got so overwhelming and intense that i didn't notice i started building distance with my best friend because i concentrated on new people too much. Eventually we got so far from each other that we barely even talk. We still respect each other and are chatting on occasion trying to look like we're still those "good old friends", but i can tell that he's not okay with the situation, even despite he's trying not to show me that. I know i fucked up big time. He's my best friend that has always been there for me and i won't forgive myself if i'll lose him. So, reddit, what do i do? I know it would be the best just to tell about the situation, but i can't find proper words and it pains me. Thanks in advance.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","no. Reasoning: The post does convey some sense of distress and concern about the deteriorating friendship. The poster acknowledges their mistake and expresses a desire to fix the situation, as losing their best friend would be painful. However, the post does not exhibit the intense emotional pain, exhaustion, or hopelessness typically associated with very severe depression. The primary focus is on seeking advice and finding the right words to address the situation rather than overwhelming emotional distress."
"Post: How do I deal with feeling worthless? I’ve had a bad day and this is on top of just a long few years of my life where I can’t remember the last time I’ve truly been happy. I have a few friends but the more my life has gone on, the more I’ve realized certain dislikings i have towards them. I want to meet new people and do new things, something that my friends aren’t interested in or don’t have time for. I’m as bad as you could imagine when it comes to making new friends because I can be really socially awkward and I’m convinced that few other people share specific interests that I would look for in friends or a girlfriend. I have few (if any) aspirations in life and I just feel like I’m drifting through life without any idea what I want. I don’t feel like I’ve accomplished much in my life, I’m in college but I’ve never held a job before and I’m hardly passionate enough about a career to really be interested to want to pursue it. Maybe this sounds like a really pathetic post but I honestly don’t know what to do. I just feel alone and unmotivated to do anything in life.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of worthlessness, unhappiness, and a lack of fulfillment in life. The poster describes a long period of time where they have not experienced true happiness and have few friends who they feel disconnected from. They express a desire to meet new people and engage in new activities, but feel socially awkward and have doubts about finding people who share their specific interests. The lack of aspirations and passion in life, as well as not knowing what to do, further contribute to a sense of hopelessness and lack of motivation. These statements align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as low self-esteem, loss of interest, social withdrawal, and a sense of emptiness."
"Post: Reluctant to get diagnosed I'm reluctant to go to the doctor and find out if I have depression. I can't exactly explain this, but it's a combination of a few things. Part of me feels that I'm asking to be depressed and another part of me fears that I don't have depression and my problems are all just my own fault.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses hesitancy and reluctance to seek a diagnosis for depression, suggesting that the poster may be experiencing some internal conflict or fear surrounding this issue. They mention a belief that they may be "asking to be depressed," indicating a possible negative self-perception or guilt. The fear that their problems are their own fault further highlights feelings of self-blame or a lack of self-worth. These thought patterns and emotions are commonly associated with depression, particularly in regards to feelings of guilt, self-blame, and a reluctance to seek help."
"Post: 4 years Tuesday Tuesday will be the four year anniversary of when my dad committed suicide. My 21st birthday was this weekend and I got pretty drunk and started to think about it and I just cried and cried in the Uber with my friends. I’m really thankful for them. But there isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about him. The thing is, he was an asshole. To me and my mom. I didn’t know he was depressed, I just thought he was mean and didn’t love me. I really do think I could’ve prevented it if I’d known. I’ve been extremely depressed ever since it happened. I don’t think I’ll ever be normal again.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep and profound emotional pain related to the anniversary of the poster's father's suicide. The mention of getting drunk and crying, as well as the statement of being extremely depressed since the event, indicates a high level of ongoing emotional distress. The post also includes feelings of guilt and self-blame, suggesting a possible struggle with self-esteem and feelings of responsibility for the father's actions. The statement that the poster does not think they will ever be "normal" again implies a long-lasting and debilitating impact on their emotional well-being. These emotions align with the symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Movies to fill the hole inside of you Movies I watched because I felt empty inside but afterwards I felt even worse like I just lost someone Mr Nobody (especially this one) Lost in translation I origins Sorry, I dont have too many, Im mostly looking for movies to watch, maybe you have some to recommend","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","yes. Reasoning: The post demonstrates a sense of emptiness and the desire to fill that void by watching movies. The poster explicitly states that they feel worse after watching movies, indicating a lack of fulfillment or satisfaction from activities that are typically enjoyable. This aligns with symptoms of depression, as it suggests a difficulty in finding pleasure or meaning in things that used to bring joy. The overall tone of the post implies a sense of sadness and longing, suggesting a potential underlying depressive state."
"Post: My wife wants another baby, I don't. Are we headed for divorce? Hi all, I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this so let me know if it's not. The title pretty much is why I'm here but let me give you some background. My wife and I dated for about a year before she got pregnant. We quickly got married and had our first girl in 2005. In 2008 we had our son, followed by our third, another girl, in 2009. We were crazy busy for a while there and things finally calmed down a few years ago. We made up for that by deciding that we should move to a nicer area. We live in Vancouver where property costs a fortune. To afford that, my wife had to go back to work full time. She had been working 3 days a week. She is a teacher so she still gets the summers, Christmas and spring break at home with the kids. She kind of half joked about having a fourth child before the move but when we moved it was clear that we couldn't afford another baby. Now we've been in our new home for about 1.5 years. The kids have made new friends, settled into their new school and sports teams. Our oldest will be heading to high school next year. Now my wife wants a new baby. She is obsessed with it. It's all she thinks about and all she talks about. She says the kids are getting older and they're not going to need her soon and she's getting depressed about it. Every couple weeks it boils over and we fight or she bursts into tears again. I don't want another baby. Our youngest is 8, our oldest is 12. I don't want to go back there. I've moved on from the baby stage and I love where we're at right now. We are crazy busy with sports and activities most of the year (hockey x2, baseball x3, swimming, art class, etc....). I am happy where we are, I don't feel like anything is missing, there's no hole in my life. If we were to have another baby, we'd have to move again. Change the kids schools again. Have the kids meet new friends again and join new sports teams again. I don't want to do that to them. I've also been carrying the financial burden for the last 12 years as my wife had finally give back to work full time. I'm not saying she wasn't working at home taking care of the kids, she was. I am saying that if we missed a mortgage payment, that was on me and it's stressful and it's nice to have some sort on that department once again. I don't really know what to do, I'm afraid we're headed for a divorce but that's the last thing I want. Should I have a baby so she won't divorce me? What if we're in the same spot eight years from now when the baby starts to grow up a bit. I asked her if she would go speak to a counselor with me but she says it won't change her mind that she wants another baby.","Question: The answer to the question "Does the poster suffers from depression?" is","no. Reasoning: The post demonstrates emotional distress and conflict within the relationship, but it does not exhibit clear indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses concern and frustration regarding their wife's desire for another baby and the potential impact it may have on their finances, lifestyle, and the well-being of their current children. They also express a fear of divorce and a lack of clarity on how to navigate this situation. While there may be some underlying emotional distress, the post primarily focuses on the specific issue of disagreement over having another child and seeking advice on how to handle the situation, rather than displaying the overwhelming hopelessness and despair commonly associated with very severe depression."
