I understand that there comes nerves with a new start but I'm starting to wonder if it's all worth the effort if I was so much happier in my previous job, not just doing the work but it didn't invade my life with thoughts when I wasn't there. I have suffered from depression before, though not connected to work, and I can feel that the longer I am at my new job the less I'm enjoying my life.

Though I only slept 2 hours and a half, I managed to wet his sleeping bag, his sofa, and both my pants and my dress.

"Consider this post: ""Recently I received some bad news at home _ another health issue one would think would never impact me, even indirectly.  I don__ want to get into those details, but it led me to decide I needed to stop medication because my __uck_ is so bad no matter how good the medication I am still going to endure an incessant stream of negative events and circumstances that will overwhelm me.  My life is a story of waste: Brilliant, but not using that brain power at work; successful, but not enough to reach my goals.  Nothing ever comes easy and I see bad people left and right get their way.  It drives me nuts, and feeds into the __lack and white thinking_ that plagues me.  So I met with my doctor to ask how to get off my medication altogether.  Previously, he expressed shock at the cocktail I was taking and said he would not continue the malpractice of my old doctor, who recently closed her practice.  He did not try to convince me to stay on the medication, or change to something else.  I__ thankful he was honest about the methods to get off the pills.  But, it turns out the safe way to get off my medications will require over a year of weaning off them.  I wanted to stop going to doctors soon, but now I have to go through this process for over a year.  I handled the news well, surprisingly well. Still, it is incredibly difficult to live with my negative thinking, disturbing life events, a constant sense of failure and inadequacy, and potential withdrawals so serious I have to go through a year of tapering off meds.  I just needed to vent.  I feel like I have no one and nothing.  I constantly mutter things under my breath (often without realizing it) such as __ hate my life._  It__ just hard to see how the story of my life turns out well.""

"Consider this post: ""Classmate/ bullying problems
I have a classmate who constantly bullies our other classmates. Seems like she feels as if she is superior, the leader of our whole class and everyone has to follow and do what she says. If someone is late to the meetings she is harassing them. She is being very rude and insulting. Her voice is always extremely loud, and if she has a problem with people she always shouts it to the class instead of approaching the person and discussing it with them like a normal person would do.

For example, she was upset with a group of her classmates because they didnt want to follow whatever she says, and she heard that they might have said something bad about her, but instead of approaching them to ask them about it, if its true or whatsoever, everytime we have meetings she will just talk extra loud and will let our whole class listen to her nonsense comments like she keeps on talking about ""fake people"", as if she wanted the group who said something about her to hear it and feel guilty.

I dont get why she does it and why she is the way she is. Does anyone have an idea? And what should we do about it? It's getting annoying and I know already if we would approach and talk to her she would put the blame on everyone else and just be more mad and find stupid excuses. Does anyone have any advice? By the way, including teachers or some other people doesnt help either so any other advices or info to shed light on this is welcome. Thank you"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The poster describes a classmate who exhibits aggressive, domineering, and confrontational behavior. This individual seems to be seeking control over their peers, often resorting to public humiliation and indirect, passive-aggressive tactics rather than direct communication.

"Consider this post: ""Does anyone else get such intrusive thoughts like “I hate myself, I should cut myself, I wanna die” that are so intense you have to say it out loud?
Sometimes when I get into a cycle of negative thoughts they are so strong and it’s just automatic that I say it out loud. Sometimes if just comes out as an “oh my god” but other times I actually say those thoughts to myself. Physically telling myself that I’m stupid, I have no worth, I wish I could die.

Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster is trapped and defenseless in a compulsive mindset of self-loathing, wanting to self-harm, and wanting to commit suicide.

"Consider this post: ""Nothing is enjoyable anymore.
Almost everything that I used to care for is simply starting to have no meaning. I feel dead and lifeless.

Everyday I wake up and I’m angry. Always wondering what the hell the point of this is. Why I’m here. 

I used to be extremely suicidal in the past and I’m slowly falling into that dark pit again. I don’t know what to do.

It’s so hard to be happy and I’m just... I’m starting to give up."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster mentions that activities and passions they once enjoyed now hold no meaning for them.

"Consider this post: ""The good times don't make the bad times worth living.
People always act like it's worth living through bad times so you can experience the good times but to me it doesn't feel worth it.

""How do you live like this? Why are you being like this? Your brothers aren't like this?""

If we're going to have a face off over who has the lower opinion of me, I guarantee, I will win every time. Or at least I hope I will because if not they hate me more than I can imagine.

"Consider this post: ""No friend left behind? *short*
I have a small tight knit group of friends, 6 of us total, who have been friends since early high school years (so about 10/15 years at least). 
Everybody has their annoying qualities but one of our friends tends to annoy every one of us at different points. This has never changed our friendship. 
Recently, 4 of them have decided that we should make plans without the “annoying one”. They have begun a group text about plans for hanging out which don’t include her just because they don’t know if they can handle her.
I love my friends but I feel this is absolutely horrible to do behind someone’s back, especially someone who they’ve been friends with for so long. I would be devastated if they did that to me and I have a feeling she will find out one way or another. Because of that, I don’t want to be in the discussion with them at all and won’t attend any event they plan in such a sneaky way. I feel like if they didn’t want to be friends anymore they should say something to her to give her a fair chance.
Am I overthinking this or on track?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The poster is expressing feelings of discomfort, conflict, and a moral dilemma concerning their group of friends' behavior. They're empathetic towards the friend being excluded and are concerned about the ethics of the situation.While the post suggests feelings of unease and distress regarding the situation, it doesn't directly provide evidence that the poster is suffering from depression. The emotions conveyed are related to a specific circumstance involving friendships and a moral standpoint, rather than broader symptoms or feelings commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""dealing with an emotionally unavailable best friend
I see my best friend a lot. I dont wear my heart on my sleeve but I'm emotional. I definitely give too much in a relationship and end up getting hurt because of it. My friend has troubles expressing her emotions and generally gets very annoyed when she has to ""prove herself"" because she feels like people should just trust her. She doesn't have many friends because of this. I always express my irrational feelings but when shes angry she doesnt want to say anything because she doesnt want to hurt me. I don't want her to hold anything in but I know that I would suffer because of the truth.

How do I balance our give and take? 
Is there anyway I can help her open up? Or is that impossible?
"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates emotional struggles, vulnerability, and challenges in their relationship with their friend, but these factors alone don't necessarily equate to depression.The focus of the post is on seeking solutions to the posters' dilemmas with their friend, which indicates that the overall tone of the post remains rational and positive."
"Consider this post: ""When will this inescapable wait ever end?
I feel as though this is never ending and nothing good will ever come out of it. I’m underserving. I have both a long-term mental illness and a long-term physical illness. One’s willpower is limited. I struggle everyday both 
 physically and mentally/emotionally. It’s been years. My physical illness affects my mental illness and vice versa but they are offend uncontrollable! I suffer from chronic low self-esteem due to my illnesses. I don’t know I just feel hopeless and helpless. My willpower feels drained. I don’t know how much longer I can keep holding on. It’s not holding on that’s difficult. What’s difficult is holding on when there may be no meaning to it. What if I hold on with all my will and I find out there’s nothing to it.

I don't know if I don't love him anymore. I don't know if I can get past my resentment. I don't know. **Tl'dr: I feel numb to my boyfriend after a series of arguments/events that have left me not feeling loved or like a priority to my boyfriend."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster mentions several factors indicating potential stress. They express a lack of direction in life, nervousness about securing employment, feelings of loneliness due to prioritizing work over personal relationships, and issues within their romantic relationship, including feeling unloved and not prioritized.

"Consider this post: ""I go from living happily, almost as if that part of my life didn't happen, to being floored by pain. I feel guilty to myself for how strong the reactions are so many years later. I feel guilty to my partner who has to deal with it even though he's not the one who caused me this hurt.

He yelled and throw things and sometimes shoved me around too, but me he never got that physical with like he did with my oldest brother. My dad also cried a lot and forced me to listen to him talk about his sad childhoos and then had me comfort him."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The description of life with their father reveals an unstable and emotionally turbulent environment. The father's frequent drinking, anger, mood swings, and physical aggression, even if it was more severe towards the oldest brother, are sources of stress. Moreover, the role reversal where the child is made to listen and comfort the father about his traumatic childhood further adds emotional strain. Such an environment can result in emotional distress and long-term stress for the individual recounting these experiences."
"Consider this post: ""I did a few times but it always just blew up in us breaking up and then me being miserable for awhile. I just don't know if I should bother anymore and commit to the fact that I'm alone and will probably be for the rest of my life.

I’m on edge constantly because I need a break to just start over. And now I’m on the way to a 3 day work seminar in another country and I feel like there is zero mental energy left. I get back and then have work on Monday again. Anyone else feel like they need a day or two alone to “recharge” their (mental) energy?""

"Consider this post: ""Discovering LimeWire was like breathing in fresh mountain air in the early hours of the morning while there is dew glazed over the leaves on the trees and surrounding grass. I felt a real connection with Post Hardcore/ Alternative. During this time I knew of Anxiety, but I didn't know OF it. In other words, I considered it a personality trait and not something treatable, more or less just apart of me. Playing video games secluded in my room and swimming on a variety of swim teams kept me sane to an extent but I was living in an isolated bubble."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster mentions feeling a connection with genres like Post Hardcore/Alternative, which often tackle emotional and sometimes distressing topics.

"Consider this post: ""Hey ya'll. I'm okay. I'm trying to be okay with being okay. I've been trying lots of things lately, and I'm certainly seeing the results of my bravery. I've sobered up. I just got a job that I'm super motivated about, and I think after a few weeks I'll really be able to rock the shit out of it. All in all, I've learned a lot about self-care and self-love in the past month. In the grand scheme, I feel like I might finally be out of the rabbit hole, and can finally get my life moving again. But at the same time, I feel alone. I finally accept myself again, which is the most important step. But I feel like no one else wants to share the riches if found within myself. I'm a pretty cool guy, I make pretty cool music, and I'm pretty damn funny. But I have no one to sing for, and no one to make laugh. And as much as I appreciate my own company, it would be nice to have someone who values me as much as I do. That might come off as egotistical, but hey I'm a human being and yeah I have an ego. Sometimes I still need someone to take care of me, and I feel like I'm coming up short. I could really use a companion right about now. Some one to let me know that it truly is worth it to try to be the best version of myself. Someone more than my mom and my mirror. If you're alone tonight, I might be too. So let's maybe not be alone?"" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1.
