"Consider this post: ""Does anyone have any suggestions for dealing with major depressive? I‚Äôm 20 years old and I‚Äôve had depression since I was around 13. Everyday is a challenge and I‚Äôm at the point in which I feel like I‚Äôm losing myself. My closest friends live in different countries and I‚Äôm emotionally exhausted from holding onto all of my problems without talking about them. I feel like life would be easier to give up rather than fighting constantly with myself, but my family would be distraught over me hurting myself and they‚Äôve done a lot for me so I‚Äôm resorting to telling people on the internet in the hope that someone knows how to deal with dark thoughts and the lack of emotions that I don‚Äôt feel anymore. - Cereal"" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?"
"Consider this post: ""So, I'm medicated but not in therapy, and this is more a collection of thoughts than a coherent chain, but it's something I've been thinking about often of late. Anyway, here we go. &amp;nbsp; I want to be neurotypical. It sucks there's no cure for depression, you know? And that NT people have no fucking frame of reference talking about depression, like I have no frame of reference talking to someone with bipolar, which brings me to my next point. &amp;nbsp; Depression isn't ""really sad,"" you can't even fucking be sad when you're depressed. You can't enjoy the things you used to enjoy. For me, depression has always been this suffocating apathy, and ""feeling"" isn't an option. I'm not crying because I'm sad, I'm crying because I'm feeling nothing, and it feels pointless. &amp;nbsp; I want to be a whole person. I'm not motivated. There's nothing I really want from life. &amp;nbsp; ""I took the medicine, but the pills don't work, the pills they don't do anything, but rearrange all the littlest things."" This is a lyric by the band Streetlight Manifesto. Like I mentioned, I'm on medication, but the suicidal ideation never stops."" Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?"

"Consider this post: ""Ive never felt so alone. Everything I do pales in comparison to others, my life just feels stale and bland. Especially with relationships... 19 and never had anyone attracted to me! I feel like a loser. I am not really good at anything either, I practice but I just never see myself improving, sports, losing weight, drawing, being social-- They just don't work for me. So ive just given up on doing anything. It won't matter Nobody cares about me anyway, I just am alone. Last night I sat up and scrolled around on Facebook and saw all these people partying and these couples kissing and it just upset me for the whole day. Now I realize how much I don't really matter.""

"Consider this post: ""I‚Äôm not relatively new to depression, as I have been suffering from it for nearly 3 years now. But there are a whole lot of different things at play that are contributing to my depression. My severe anxiety over work, relationships, friendships, and money. And the worst is the intrusive thoughts. Not just about suicide, though. Other things as well and I‚Äôm sad to say I‚Äôve acted on these thoughts already. Not proud, but I can‚Äôt fix it now. I don‚Äôt really need any consoling or anything. I‚Äôm not considering ending my life because I have no reason to. I am fully aware these thoughts are the depression and not my true thoughts. I don‚Äôt need help as I can still maintain control. I just really really needed to get this off my back to someone, even if it is a bunch of random people.""
