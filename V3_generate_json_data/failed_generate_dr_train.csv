"Consider this post: ""I feel like a prisoner I absolutely hate life. I hate it. I hate the world. I don’t want to live. But if I kill myself, I can’t imagine what I would put my family through. The sole reason I live is to not hurt my family. On the other hand, I can’t stand life. My mind...it’s like I’m terrified of living. There’s this dread I constantly feel from living. I know for sure I won’t be able to endure this for a full lifetime. Even a year seems too long. I don’t know what to do. I’m trapped in my mind. The only way out would destroy my family, but I can’t even stand the thought of hurting my family."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?"
"Consider this post: ""Awaiting the downward spiral. Had an awesome weekend with a whole bunch of friends from online who all came together, from all around Australia, for three days of drinking and festivities. Now I've travelled home and I'm all alone again. It's great that I have so many fantastic friends Online, but it's horrible we all live so far away. I'm already missing them terribly, and feeling down. I know that I'm about to spiral downwards even futher after having gotten drunk for three days. It's inevitable, but I'm trying to prepare. I'm going to try and draw, spend time with my Service Parrot and submerge myself in my gaming community. To keep myself as positively distracted as I can. I'm already trapped in an endless loop of thinking about my ex, who I still love and miss so much, and beating myself up. Searching for answers and ways how I could of been a better person for him. He told me he hated me and that I made him feel like a child. But i never intended for my help to make him feel like that. I tried to support and encourage him with everything. Emotionally and financially. I pushed myself to work 30+hrs a week when I was anxious and depressed because he became so closed off, so we had a roof over our head and food in our belly when we were made homeless. I tried to help him with being motivated to work, and to be able to support himself. I gave him every part of myself, because I loved him so much. And I keep holding on to things he said, before he forgot what this love really meant to him. And all the love that I gave to him, that never got into him. No matter how hard I tried. I wish he knew I don't hate him for what he said to me and that my suicide attempts weren't to make him feel guilty. I genuinely wanted to end my life. The thoughts of whatever I had done for him to hate me weighs so heavy upon me, that I fear to live with a guilt that was my own. I failed to be the person he wanted me to be, but worse; I failed to be the person I needed to be for him. Now we're 2000km apart and, Emotionally, I'm struggling to keep my head up. Financially, I know He's struggling too. Everyone keeps teling me I shouldn't care about him, but that just makes me hate myself more, that I do. I know I'm going to spiral further, it's inevitable, but I'm trying to prepare. *breathes* Edits: Grammr/Punctuation"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?"
"Consider this post: ""Why does anyone care? Its not like my life can get any better it doesn't do no good talking to anybody either because I just end up turning them against me my best friend a guy that I look up to as a brother doesn't even want anything to do with me anymore. I'm just absolutely pathetic just absolutely pathetic even if I can't join back with them I would at least like to talk to them and help them out if I could if not then what's the point I know they're tired of seeing me post about them and I can't help it they're my friends whether they want to admit it or not and I care about them very much. :("" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?"
"Consider this post: ""Feeling numb...? Has anyone else reached the point where they realise that they were emotionally numb in the past or still are now? Last year, my grandfather passed away and it was a sad time for the family. I was upset, but no where near what I think I should have been. I still have a hard time getting truly excited about things that should be fun, like going back to uni and seeing friends etc. It's hard feeling to describe. Dazed or aloof maybe? If I do feel any emotional intensity, it's anger or irritability."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?"
"Consider this post: ""Friendships into the 30s I’ve realized as I’ve gotten older, people do truly come and go. And it’s heartbreaking. Friends who you thought would meet your kids and be there for decades. I just think of the good times in the past and wonder why humans were designed this way — to seemingly make lasting connections, but to later discover it was all a lie.""
