"Consider this post: ""Found out my oldest brother and his wife encouraged my little sister to sleep with a married man nearly 40 years her senior because it would help her learn to appreciate her body and get over past bad experiences. Title says it all. I am ready to seriously harm my brother. Nearly punched several holes in the wall when I found this info out. I can’t vent to anyone at all right now, but I needed to vent somewhere."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?"
"Consider this post: ""Lately I’ve been thinking about the fact that dying doesn’t scare me and I honestly don’t care if I do. The only thing that bothers me is how it would affect the people around me. I don’t want to die necessarily the idea of it just doesn’t bother me."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?"
"Consider this post: ""I just took a shower for the first time in 2 weeks, and I just washed my hair for the first time in months. I know that's absolutely disgusting, but Depression has made me lose all will to do anything, and that includes hygiene. I know it's pathetic to be proud of myself for doing something normal people do every day, but I can't help but feel happy about myself."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?"
"Consider this post: ""I am tired of spending every weekend crying. It didn't used to be this bad. I was fine being alone and forgotten. I don't know what changed though. I guess it all just caught up to me. I have felt depressed for as long as I can remember but I was always able to handle it. I am really losing it lately though. Last year was bad. This year is already worse. I am too much of a quitter to make things better. I don't even know why I am posting this. I guess I just want someone to know I was hear.""

"Consider this post: ""Anxiety and Depression make you contradict and lose yourself I've had enough. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for months and the whole situation is fucking my mind up. I know I should face my problems but I don't want to and that amplifies my anxiety. I just wish people ignored me and yet I feel lonely. I don't want to be hurt and yet I am the one hurting myself. There is so many things I'd like to do but in the end I end up wasting time on the bed. There is many things I want and yet I can't bring myself to work and get them. If I oversleep I feel like shit, If I sleep too little I feel like shit. I've talked about my situation with my family and they are trying to support me (I'll start therapy in September) but I can't help feeling like a burden... My motto has always been ""The truth is in the middle"" but I've completely lost any direction and orientation. I've been costantly questioning myself and I don't even know what I want nor who I am anymore. I apoligize if this doesn't make sense but I just needed to let it out a bit.""
