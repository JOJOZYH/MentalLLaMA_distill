"Consider this post: ""I've been angry all weekend. Caused me to be really rude to my parents and got in a huge fight with them and then they got in a huge fight. My friends all decided I wasn't worth their time last night. Realized they might not really be true friends. Had suicidal thoughts for the first time last night. Girl I really like decided that she didn't want a relationship and told me today. My guitar teacher got super frustrated with me because I suck and couldn't play the music he gave me and got a bunch of questions wrong. Music, running, biking, and video games no longer give me an escape from this pain and anger I feel all the time. Needed to vent."" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?"
"Consider this post: ""I just wanted to get this off my chest. I have a feeling these past months thinking my dad will die soon. I feel it‚Äôs going to come and I won‚Äôt be able to make him happy. I can‚Äôt make him happy. I feel he‚Äôs been depressed for so long. I don‚Äôt know how to make him happy. I have tried everyday to think about positive things and how I would make him happier, but I can‚Äôt. My mindset is not right because he makes the family (my mom and I) unhappy everyday. He is always grumpy and I don‚Äôt know how to cheer him up. He doesn‚Äôt want to do anything. I don‚Äôt feel like trying anymore. I know he‚Äôs dying soon. I am so sad because of it. I am so sad I don‚Äôt get to spend enough time with him to make him happy. I‚Äôm sad because I disappointed him for not working and wanting to study. He wanted me to work instead of study. But that logic is flawed. Because I need to finish school so I can get a better job. For him. But he‚Äôs dying. And that makes me so unmotivated to do anything. Sometimes I feel like dying first. I want to give up life. Life is too hard."" Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?"

"Consider this post: ""Hey guys, I'm hoping someone could shed some light on a situation for me. I have been diagnosed with major depression disorder and an anxiety disorder. I have been suffering from.bith severe depression and severe anxiety for about 9 months and after trying numerous things to resolve it (including self medicating) I had finally decided to give medication a try. At first I was put on citalopram, this caused many severe side effects like increased anxiety, insomnia, constantly sweating, nausea, dry mouth etc. But I had a period where for 2 days I had worsening of depressive symptoms, suicidal thoughts and very impulsive - like - uncontrollable anxiety (with constant shaking for 2 days straight). I visited my doctor as this frightened me and immediately switched my medication to effexor. I recall before that episode had happened I had binged on counterfeit oxy and counterfeit Xanax (two pills I have been self medicating with as it's the only thing that helps me feel ""good""). I of course didn't bring this up to my doctor and I am now wondering is it possible that the drugs used to self medicate might be causing alternative effects with the antidepressants? The effexor seems to be a better fit for me as I didn't have many side effects but I still had a similar episode I had before. It all starts with a painful headache, then horrible thoughts and followed by uncontrollable anxiety that doesn't seem to die down. I remember I self medicated the second time in hopes it would stop the episode but that either didn't work or made it worse. Does anyone have any insight on this they could share?""
