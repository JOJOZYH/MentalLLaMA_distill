"Consider this post: ""I'm severely depressed but not suicidal. I feel disconnected from almost everyone and everything. I know what needs to be done to change things but have no motivation to do so. There are times where I'm so down I just want to cry. I keep being told I'm a great guy, a good person, that I'm loved. Therapy, getting a pet, becoming a foster parent, and online dating have all been suggested today from my work spouse and one of my best friends. I tried a med change this month but it made things worse. I feel left behind, that I'm not living the life I should. Also told I don't give myself enough credit. Here's the thing, depressed and intelligent people are very in tune with their thought processes. I know I'm not terribly smart but I have eyes. I give myself exactly as much credit as I deserve and have very little to offer. Yes I have good qualities but they're dwarfed when compared to what others have to offer. Am I really being too hard on myself or am I onto something here about being beneath everything and everyone?"" Question: Does the intellectual wellness dimension exist in the post?"

"Consider this post: ""Last summer I started college in a new city away from home. I was desperate to find friends since I was in a new city and managed to make 2 or 3 decent friends and I have since lost contact with them for various reasons. Then I managed to meet a girl at my new job and I fell in love with her. Everything about her was perfect for me and I felt like we bonded really well, except for the fact that she had a boyfriend. She was unhappy with her relationship and I hoped to help her get out of a toxic relationship and make her my own. Today she friendzoned me and said she's staying with her boyfriend, and now I'm completely alone all over again with no friends and nobody I care enough about to live for. Sure, my family might care for a couple weeks but after that I would be forgotten forever if I was gone. I have no motivation to go and make new friends and I feel like if I talk to any new girls I'm just going to think about this first girl and want her back. I just want to end it all and never have to deal with this complete feeling of loneliness ever again."" Question: Does the emotional wellness dimension exist in the post?"
"Consider this post: ""I'm a 22 y/o woman almost finished with my TMS therapy for my MDD. I've definitely felt the dip, and things have gotten so much better over the past few weeks. The issue I'm having though is that I feel like a completely different person. In some ways it's good, but I feel like I'm re-learning how to live. Some of my interests have changed, things physically feel different, I don't feel as invested in my relationships, and in a strange way I miss my depression because it was like a comforting imaginary friend that was always there. I'm very happy for the most part, and remission has been an awesome experience, but it's also terrifying. Has anyone else experienced these types of things in their remission? If so, how did you deal with it?"" Question: Does the intellectual wellness dimension exist in the post?"
"Consider this post: ""This time last year, I was talking to my soon-to-be girlfriend, excited for the new year. Now I'm alone, suicidal and worse than last year. Shit doesn't change.

"Consider this post: ""I'm rewatching Bojack Horseman on Netflix for the umpteenth time because that's the only thing I do that I enjoy anymore. I've recently noticed that in the show Secretariat is right, that you should never stop ruining, never look back, all that you have is what's ahead. That's what I've been doing and it seems to be working as long as I don't stop. My last relationship almost killed me, my ex was abusive. Before her I survived since shit, sexual assaults and the like. I've done terrible things too, things for survival, some things simply because I was a bastard. Now i keep myself busy. I work 50+ hrs and volunteer for the entire weekend. I have pets that need constant attention, and I'm constantly moving. When I'm not running around I always have a drink in hand. It works. The only time I look back is when I'm falling asleep, that's the worst. That's when I can't escape it. Thankfully sleep cones soon. But I need to keep moving. If I stop I'll be consumed. Im terrified of that. I can't handle that. I can't relive it, I just can't. I don't know what to do anymore. I come from a long line of alcoholics and I'm fast on my way to join them. I'm so tired but I can't risk showing down. I just wish it would end but I'm too scared to do anything about it. I'm ruining as fast and as hard as I can but I'm slowing down and it's catching up. I thought it would get easier but it isn't."" Question: Does the spiritual wellness dimension exist in the post?"
