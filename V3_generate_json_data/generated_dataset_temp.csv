"Consider this post: ""Will I ever be with somebody? I'm so lonely. I'm 19 and I don't have a clue what a relationship feels like. All my friends are talking about marriage and I've never even had a real kiss I cared about. I didn't think I was that bad, I guess I was wrong. I know there are people who go much longer without finding anyone special but I really hope that doesn't happen to me.
