      "(': You will be presented with a post and an assigned label to identify whether the poster\\nshows symptoms of depression. Consider the emotions expressed from post to explain the reasoning of the label step by step.\\nHere are some examples:\\n\\n### Expert-written examples:\\nQuery: Consider this post: \"The one and only thing I want to and have a will to do is to listen to the music all day and space out in it.\\nEverything else is boring, draining and dull. And I receive no mental pleasure from doing anything else.\" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?\\nResponse: Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post describes a state of low desire, where the poster can\\'t bring themselves to do anything but listen to music. Low interest in things, low motivation, and getting bored easily are all symptoms of depression. This indicates that the poster is in a more dangerous emotional state.\\n\\nQuery: Consider this post: \"They weep after every session with me and all I can do is give them the thousand yard stare. I don\\'t even know how to feel yet my girlfriend says I\\'m selfless to a fault how I can be I don\\'t know she always says she wishes she could have rescued kid me from my mother and has been the saint of a women that is still by my side and still wants to marry me. How and why I don\\'t know I feel worthless ans like I have nothing to offer up other than my love and the constant promise I\\'ll never leave her. I have lashed out so many times at her for things not even done by her and I die inside a little more everytime I do. I know she knows why it happens and understands the brain chimstry behind my psych issues as she is a sociology and psychology major/minor.\" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?\\nResponse: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes deep emotional reactions such as weeping and feelings of worthlessness. They also mention the strain in their relationship, as evidenced by instances of lashing out at their girlfriend and feeling regret afterwards. The reference to their past with their mother, the need to be \"rescued,\" and the mention of their psychological issues all indicate significant emotional turmoil and stress.\\n\\nQuery: Consider this post: \"I want to feel like I belong here. I wish there were people whom I could connect with. Unfortunately, I don\\'t know where life is taking me right now. I\\'m too tired of the everyday grind. Life has become a constant struggle. I wish this agony would end. I\\'ve been hoping for a long time. I thought I had people by my side. There are people who care but I don\\'t know why I\\'m not able to connect with them. I just feel empty. :( I\\'ve endured for a long time. I just wish this would end some day.\" Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?\\nResponse: Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual expresses a desire to feel like they belong and connect with others, indicating a lack of connectedness.\\n2. They mention not knowing where life is taking them and feeling tired of the everyday grind, suggesting a potential lack of purpose or fulfillment.\\n3. The individual expresses a sense of agony and constant struggle, indicating distress and potential inadequacy of connectedness.\\n4. They mention having people who care but not being able to connect with them, which suggests difficulty in forming meaningful relationships.\\n\\nQuery: Consider this post: \"i\\'m a foreveralone with suicidal depression. i need to be held, by fucking anyone at this point. i don\\'t have the money for a prostitute otherwise thats what i\\'d do. i posted a craigslist ad but im a random 32 year old man and no one\\'s gonna be sympathetic probably. i need to be touched. i don\\'t know what to do. i cannot leave the house, i cannot and do not care anymore to develop social skills to find a woman, nor would any woman want to date an unemployed balding 5\\'6\" suicidal depression sufferer on disability. i am at a breaking point to be completely honest. what do i do. i want to be held and stroked and comforted physically. i swear to god i am not looking for sex. i don\\'t have my dog with me anymore. my family won\\'t let me live with them.\" Question: Does the vocational wellness dimension exist in the post?\\nResponse: Yes, this wellness dimension exists in the post. Reasoning: Although the post primarily focuses on the person\\'s emotional state and their desire for physical comfort, they mention being unemployed and on disability. This indicates that their vocational aspect is present as it relates to their work or lack thereof.\\n\\nQuery: Consider this post: \"There aren\\'t words for how pissed I am right now, or how much I\\'m going to freak out if I don\\'t find it.\" Question: What is the stress cause of this post?\\nResponse: This post shows the stress cause related to emotion turmoil. Reasoning: The post conveys strong feelings of frustration and the pressing need to locate something. This indicates that the poster is dealing with significant emotional stress. Without details pointing towards specific categories like work, school, or family, it\\'s clear that emotional turmoil is the primary source of the stress described.\\n\\n\\n### Now provide the reasoning for the following queries and responses in the format: {\"reasoning\": \"...\"}\\nQ1: Consider this post: \"How to avoid a relapse? I\\'ve been having a particularly rough year; I attempted suicide, the love of my life left me, I failed my year at university, I\\'ve been physically assaulted, I\\'ve been sexually assaulted and today my grandfather died. I feel like I\\'m running on empty and doing the bare minimum to survive for myself while trying to be a rock to others. My emotional resilience has been wiped out. I feel \"okay\" but I\\'ve felt like this in the past and it has turned out that I\\'ve just been lying to myself and making things worse. Any advice on how to manage/process my emotions? Or just how to better understand myself?\" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?\\nResponse: Yes\\n', [('Consider this post: \"How to avoid a relapse?
