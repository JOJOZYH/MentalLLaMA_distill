"Consider this post: ""The Irony of Loneliness in an Overpopulated World As I spend more time in the presence of depression, I've tried to apply a further focus to understand what's actually going on in my head. Dealing with the sudden appearance of depression has been a nightmare and a half to deal with to say the least. So in response, I regularly attempt to interpret the spiral of self loathing thoughts and whirlwind of emotions that march throughout my mind. My initial reaction to a diagnosis of major depression and multiple failed suicide attempts has been to run away from everything that reeks of painful memories, both theoretically and literally: * I write this post 7,000 kilometres from my home country, in Japan, where I aim to live for the next couple of years. * ‎I've ghosted those whom I use to call my close friends. * I left all social media in order to avoid contacting people that I knew, and because looking at how happy other people were brought me down. * ‎I changed my image drastically over the past year as an outward expression of the fact that I'm trying to change as a person. It's here in Japan that I've come to a terrifying realisation. I can't run from depression. Here I am, in a country where people speak a totally different language and immersed in a totally different culture to my own, writing a post about depression. Recently, I was walking the streets in search for job opportunities when I sunk into a depressed mood and began thinking about my place in the world (which always turns out well). Nothing actually matters. We work in order to pay rent, in order to stay in the same place, so that we can reliably keep a job so that we can pay rent. It's in this meaninglessness that humans as social beings look to others for comfort. Our lives are but a meaningless speck in an expanding universe. That's quite the depressing thought... And it is. But why is it that when another body's lying on top of mine, or when I'm held in a warm embrace, this thought doesn't have any impact on me? I've done quite a bit of thinking by myself, and have talked to a bunch of people from back in the psychiatric ward on what 'fixes' us. And the unfortunate answer for most of us is... Nothing. We can't be fixed. It's just how our minds work. But what if we don't have to be fixed? The hardest part about depression for me, is the intensity of the loneliness I feel. When I'm at my worst, I'm so focused on my own loneliness and the meaninglessness of my relationships, that the few connections I do have, I dismiss. Now, this isn't the case for all people suffering from depression. For a lot of people, their negative emotions are driven by a sense of worthlessness, meaninglessness or sadness. But the general consensus is, although we can't 'fix' ourselves, we can have people around us to support us when we're at our lowest. And it makes sense that as social beings, human intimacy provides us with a safety net for when depression's hitting us the hardest. Unfortunately for most of us, the type of physical and emotional intimacy that we strive for is unobtainable. In my life, depression's caused me to push away the people that I've spent time building connections with, and has limited the amount of contact I've had with strangers and people that I COULD connect with. I think it's ironic. It's ironic that in such an overpopulated world, depression is such a big issue. We're the people that need intimacy the most, so you'd think we'd be in a position where intimacy is more readily available. But that's not how the world works. Our lives are still meaningless. We still hate ourselves. And we're still alone."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays several strong emotional indicators of depression. The poster describes their experience with depression, including a diagnosis of major depression and multiple suicide attempts. They discuss feelings of self-loathing, loneliness, and a sense of meaninglessness in their relationships and the world. The post also mentions isolating oneself from friends, leaving social media, and changing their image as attempts to escape painful memories and seek personal change. The overall tone throughout the post is one of despair, hopelessness, and deep emotional distress. The poster also expresses a belief that they cannot be fixed and that depression is a fundamental part of their mind. These symptoms and beliefs align with the indicators commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""I am scared Hey guys, posting this on a throw away just incase. Anyway, a bit of back story: Me and this guy at work met because of our smoking habits. We both happen to smoke weed, so naturally we started hanging out together. It was all cool for a while, and then he started getting needy, trying to get whatever he could from me. He would ask for cash, ask me to buy him food, ask me for bud etc. Then I found out by mistake that he is a meth smoker, which is something I do not agree with at all. He just became more hostile around me after this point (not physically, only slightly verbally/emotionally), so I decided to slowly break the tie. So I started to ignore his messages and Facebook texts. I quit work btw (its been 6 months). He doesn't know where I live, but we both know that our town is very small. Basically everyone knows everyone here. So the chance of me meeting up with him in the future is very possible. Anyway, as bad as all that sounds, I want to try and mend the relationship. What should I do? I've added an image for reference: https://imgur.com/8fZq5JO Edit: I never blocked him, I deleted my account because fuck Facebook."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not display strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While the poster expresses fear and describes a difficult situation with a former acquaintance, the emotions conveyed are primarily related to the fear of potential future encounters and the desire to mend the relationship. The tone of the post is more focused on seeking advice and solutions rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress or hopelessness."
"Consider this post: ""Mental Aspects On Bullying. Hey r/family. In today’s tech savvy era it’s hard to prevent bullying so I decided to write a blog post about the mental side of bullying I know it’ll probably be removed but I want to try and help.

It focuses on the topic of bullying and the poster's intention to write a blog post about the mental aspects of bullying.

The overall tone of the post is positive, expressing a desire to help and wishing others a great day, which suggests a level of emotional well-being rather than severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""Possessive friends Hi there, this is my first post. I became friends with a girl from my new class this year (who i had never met until we came into the same class) and became good friends with each other.She has a big network of friends and is quite different from me(talks to everyone, likes everyone, an extrovert). One day, a boy who happens to be her best friend saw us talking and got angry(for the life of me, i do not know why) and started making fake rumors about me, which she blindly believed. when she came to confront me about these false allegations, i flipped out and got quite angry and i have not talked to her for 3 days. Her friends are determined to hate me for some unknown reason and at the same time the girl has to problem with this, even defending them, saying that they are just very possessive of her. I am in a dilemma on what to do, ignore the hate or to stop caring and ignore her."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post primarily describes a situation involving conflicts with friends and feelings of confusion and anger. While there may be some emotional distress caused by the situation, such as feeling upset or uncertain about what to do, the post does not exhibit the characteristic signs of very severe depression. The focus of the post is on the interpersonal problem and seeking advice on how to handle the situation, rather than expressing deep feelings of hopelessness or despair."
"Consider this post: ""I don't know what I am living for... I honestly don't know why I keep living another day, I have no one to love me, my very friends are dick heads, my parents don't care how i am feeling and when they do they just throw a bible verse at my face acting as if talking to some sky man is going to cure me, I have yet to even hug a girl in my life, probably because I'm such an ugly awkward beta shit... I have no plans for my future, I am overall retarded In school. All I can do is be an escapist by playing video games, watching videos, eating unhealthy food, and all i do is isolate myself from reality... My therapist is overall useless, all she does is repeat the same shit I hear from people... I honestly don't comprehend why I won't just end it all..."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays a strong sense of hopelessness, despair, and self-esteem issues. The poster expresses feelings of not knowing their purpose for living and lacking love and support from friends and family. They also mention feeling ugly, awkward, and overall worthless. The lack of future plans, isolating behavior, and reliance on escapist activities suggest a disconnection from reality and an overall negative outlook on life. The mention of a therapist being useless and the statement about not comprehending why they won't end their life further emphasize a profound level of emotional distress commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""Only 7 cigarettes today This sounds really stupid but I’ve never ever practiced self control with smoking and I usually smoke anywhere from 20 to 30 cigarettes a day. I tried for the first time today to cut back and used my iPhone stop watch to try and wait 3 hours before another smoke. Drank tons and tons of water. Currently I have only had 6 today but I’m putting in the cautionary one more just in case I do before I go to bed. I dunno if it’s ok to be proud of yourself on Reddit but, that’s a cool Little win for the day in the mind of a depressive. Hope you all are fighting the good fight. Cheers EDIT: Jesus, I woke up to my inbox busting at the seams! Thanks for all the advice and kind words. Definitely going to continue the path today. Seems daunting to give up my smokes but cutting down got a lot easier with all of your support. Have a great day folks!"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post mentions being a smoker and the struggle with self-control in smoking, indicating a potential addictive behavior. The poster expresses a sense of achievement and pride in having only smoked 7 cigarettes in a day, which suggests that they may have been smoking excessively before. The mention of being a ""depressive"" suggests a history of depression or mental health struggles. While the overall tone of the post is more positive and hopeful compared to the previous example, there are still indications of emotional distress and the ongoing fight against depression."
"Consider this post: ""Well, it's been a year now since I tried killing myself A year ago on December 1st I tried to kill myself. I spent a week in a psych ward and have been on lots of meds and doing lots of therapy since then. The therapy has helped quite a bit, I've slowly learned how to listen to myself and how to take things one day at a time. As far as meds go, my anxiety is much more controllable and my sleeping meds actually work (mostly) so I can't complain too much. I don't think I'm ever going to overcome depression. I've kind of learned to live with it, sure, but beating it probably won't happen; I'm way too cynical to beat it. It's just how I'm wired. There's a lot in life I probably won't get to experience because of how I am. And I still don't know how to change that, or at least make some good out of it. I guess what I'm trying to say with this post is, I'm not sure if I'm happy or not. It's the not knowing that bugs me. I know I'm better than I was a year ago, but I still feel lost, and I don't know where to go from here. Every day is just a haze that I trot through. Sorry for the rambling. Have a good night"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post reveals a history of suicide attempts, which is a strong indicator of severe depression. The poster mentions being in therapy and taking medication, indicating ongoing treatment for their mental health. Despite some improvement in anxiety and sleep, they express a belief that they will never overcome depression and have learned to live with it. This suggests a sense of hopelessness and resignation, typical of severe depression. They also mention feeling lost and unsure of their happiness, indicating a lack of pleasure or fulfillment in their life. The overall tone of the post is one of despair, self-doubt, and emotional fog, indicating a significant level of emotional distress consistent with severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""Anyone else just drive? Idk, just like exploring places and stuff while listening to music. Can be kinda fun"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post does not indicate strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses enjoyment in driving and exploring places while listening to music, describing it as ""kinda fun."" There is no mention of any overwhelming emotional pain, exhaustion, numbness, or lack of fulfillment.

"Consider this post: ""Just a rant So today my parents came from NY to pick up the kids from me as I will be leaving the country for 6ish months soon. My soon to be ex wife leaves to move back to Japan tomorrow. This girl I started to hang out with and we both seem into each other but she has reservations about anything serious bc we work together just informed me that she is pretty much busy until I leave the country....which does coincide with one of her best friends moving as well...awful timing I know. I just feel so alone...my kids are gone...my marriage is done (im actually happy about this after months of depression)...and the person who i had started to grow closer too said we cant really hangout (probably) before I leave :/. Sorry i know others have more bigger problems but these are mine."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of loneliness, sadness, and disappointment. The poster discusses their soon to be ex-wife leaving, their children being gone, and the person they were starting to grow closer to being busy. These events contribute to a sense of feeling alone and abandoned. While the poster also mentions being happy about the end of their marriage after months of depression, the overall tone of the post indicates a significant level of emotional distress and a sense of being overwhelmed by personal difficulties. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Can we talk about personal hygiene, or lack of there of I really can’t even remember the last time I showered, and it’s not even me enjoying being a nasty bitch I just don’t want to? I mean, I don’t like feeling dirty or like I smell bad, but the thought of getting in the shower, bathing, washing my face, getting out, putting lotion on , etc. just sounds like to much work. The most I can do is brush my teeth, but other than that I lay in bed. I mean I can get up to do things that I like on a good day like painting, but for the most part I lay in bed all day. I don’t want to feel like a nasty bitch of that I’m an “unkempt” girl but at the same time I feel like I can’t help it. I also don’t want to feel like I’m using this as an excuse to be nasty but I just can’t. Just a rant because I don’t usually see a lot of people talking about it."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post highlights the lack of personal hygiene and the struggle to engage in basic self-care activities like showering and washing. The poster expresses a lack of motivation and energy to complete these tasks, despite not wanting to feel dirty or unkempt. This sense of apathy and difficulty in carrying out daily activities is indicative of the experience commonly associated with depression. The mention of spending most of the day in bed and feeling like they cannot help it further suggests a lack of motivation and involvement in daily life, which aligns with depressive symptoms. Overall, the post conveys a sense of emotional distress and a significant impact on the poster's ability to take care of themselves, indicating the presence of depression."
"Consider this post: ""The pharmacist always starts treating me like I’m fragile and could crack any minute as soon as she sees my prescription is for bupropion. I am fragile of course, but it kills me to see that visible switch from “general customer service friendly” to “you poor thing, let me treat you like the sad and fragile creature you are”. They all mean well, and it’s nice to see that they take it seriously, but I just want to be treated like I’m more than my depression. I won’t hurt myself because you didn’t call me a sweet name like honey and change the tone of your voice to one you would use worth a small child who’s upset. I know you see the dead look in my eyes and wonder if my meds aren’t strong enough or if you need to remind me yet again that I need to watch for increased thoughts of suicide. I feel better than I have in a long time, but I’m not there yet and I’m still struggling to address the root of my depression, so yeah I still look awful."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional vulnerability and frustration with how the poster is treated by the pharmacist. The poster describes feeling fragile and being treated as if they are always on the brink of cracking. They express a desire to be seen as more than their depression and to be treated with normality and respect. The mention of the ""dead look"" in their eyes and struggling to address the root of their depression suggests ongoing emotional distress. While they mention feeling better than before, their statement of still looking awful indicates that they are still struggling with their mental health. The overall tone of the post is one of frustration, sadness, and a sense of not being understood, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Do you use nostalgia to escape the present or uncertainty of the future? I have been on a nostalgic trip for awhile and it makes me feel better, but then sad again when I come back to the present. I have had quite an uncertain year since graduating, so maybe it is that quarter-life crisis. Have you been through this phase?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a pattern of using nostalgia as a means of escape from the present or uncertainty about the future. The poster mentions feeling better while indulging in nostalgia but experiencing sadness when returning to the present. This suggests a desire to avoid or cope with current emotions by reminiscing about the past. The mention of an uncertain year since graduating and the possibility of a quarter-life crisis further indicates a period of transition and potential emotional instability. While the tone of the post is not overwhelmingly anguished, it does demonstrate a level of emotional distress, introspection, and seeking validation through shared experiences, which align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""I lost my job, i'm in the worst place i have ever been, and nothing makes sense or feels fair. I have worked at the same place for nearly three years. It's an entry level retail job, but i haven't ever had anything else, so it was really the only thing that made me feel validated. Recently, for the fifth time i got passed up for a promotion, but this time marked the end. The girl who got promoted over me is one of my best friends in the world. She is absolutely amazing, and i am so happy for her, but it was the hardest to accept. She started about a year ago, and i helped train her and build her up. Fairly quickly, we became the face of the job that we did. She was my partner in everything, and i feel like i would be there for the things she couldn't do, and she would be there for the things i couldn't do. Seeing her success is the most proud i have ever been, but it's made me the most miserable. I basically found out that after busting my ass for over two years, my partner was going to be my boss. I hate that. I lost the person that was my rock in the things that i did. I don't want to work under her, i wanted to be there with her. She told me when it happened out of respect for me, and i turned in my resignation the next day. Now the only thing that made me feel validated and gave me security is gone, and i don't know what to do. My friend understood everything of course. More than just being my partner in work, she was the only person who could tell when things got really bad for me. When i hide how miserable i am, she's the first person to notice, and the only person who understands and will tell me what i need to hear. If there is any upside to all of this, it's that at least i still have my friend. In my overthinking and fear, i guess i was afraid this would change things. I learned pretty fast how much care and respect she holds for me, and i don't think anything will change that. I hope not. This job was beating me down. I trained a lot of our best staff, and i had a lot of associate come to me before management, feeling like i was more of a leader to them than our actual leadership was. We lost a lot of people due to burnout and frustration with management, but i know that i always cared about the people i got to train and help, and took a lot of pride in their success. Even after getting underpaid, undervalued, and shafted at every turn, i always stayed because i cared about the people i worked with and i wouldn't give up on them. One would think that leaving a shit situation would make me happy, but it just doesn't. Despite my 2+ years retail and leadership experience, it's been hard to find another job. Most people offer me less money than i made before (not much) and basically completely ignore any qualifications i actually have. I am in school. I finish community college this year and will move to a four year school assuming i can as my performance isn't amazing. I I want to pursue grad school to gain qualifications as an industrial/org psychologist, but everything seems so far away. I feel like with being a Psych major i'm just going to end up equally as useless with a four year degree, and even if grad school does work out, that's overall another four years from now. I have to pay bills, and i hate feeling so useless. I'm not going to starve and die or anything. My family has money, and has offered to help me pay bills if i can't find a job, but that just makes things worse in a way. I moved away from home because i wanted to be my own person. It has been three years and i haven't had to ask for help from anybody. I hate the thought that i will have to rely on these people who have given me everything to give me more. It isn't their fault that i'm a fuck up. A man said to the universe: “Sir, I exist!” “However,” replied the universe, “The fact has not created in me A sense of obligation.” - Stephen Crane I know that life isn't fair. I know nobody owes me anything, but i hate that it seems like i always end up last. My friend gets to be happy, my other friend practically runs the store now (but not enough to help, because the SM makes all the decisions and she'"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays several indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses feelings of hopelessness, despair, and inadequacy. They mention losing their job, which was a source of validation and security, and feeling devastated by the fact that their friend got promoted over them. They describe feeling alone and lacking support, as well as feeling useless and like a failure. The mention of not finding joy in activities they usually find pleasurable, such as playing video games, suggests a loss of interest or pleasure, which is a common symptom of depression. They also mention struggling with the idea of asking their family for help, which may indicate low self-esteem or negative self-perception. The overall tone of the post is one of deep emotional distress and a sense of being overwhelmed by negative emotions, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""Are any of you on agomelatine? Currently on 30mg/mirtazapine a day, which is ok aside from how hungry and sleepy it makes me (I understand that they can be desirable effects for some people but not what I’m looking for). I read a bit about agomelatine and it appears not to have those side effects but I wanted to know how real people have experienced it before asking the doctor to prescribe it. Thanks"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster is currently taking mirtazapine but is experiencing unwanted side effects such as increased appetite and sleepiness. They express interest in trying agomelatine instead and are seeking real experiences from others before discussing it with their doctor. While there may be a slight hint of frustration with the side effects of their current medication, there is no strong indication of profound emotional distress or hopelessness. The focus of the post is primarily seeking information and advice related to medication choices, rather than expressing overwhelming emotional pain or struggles commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""Is this friendship normal, and have I done the right thing? Hi everyone, I am a guy, 19 years old and I live in the Netherlands. A long time ago I managed to become friends with a 16 year old girl who lives in Spain. I already went to visit her once and we are/were very close. She is bisexual and has a 15 year old girlfriend who lives 450 kilometers away from her. I also talk a lot with that girlfriend. All friendships come with fights, but recently nothing that she does makes sense anymore. It all started when her grandma passed away 6 months ago. She was really close with her, even more then with her parents. Apart from her grandma, sister, her aunt and 2 classmates and me, nobody knows she is dating a girl. She got very depressed when her grandma died. She was barely happy, she started to get nightmares, she started cutting, and recently she says she also talks with a demon. She keeps saying stuff like ''only my girlfriend can save me'' and ''only my girlfriend can heal my wounds'' this resulted in that her girlfriend is talking with her almost daily for hours while that girlfriend actually has to study. When her girlfriend didn't pass her exams this year, the girlfriend got the blame for it. While instead she was the one claiming all of her time so that she could be 'fixed'. This fight caused her to feel even worse and she started to look at video's how to commit suicide and she started to send photo's to her girlfriend of her cuts. This is not something she told me directly, but I heard everything through her girlfriend who was very scared at this point. One evening she said ''tonight I am going to end my life''. At that moment I contacted her sister and told her everything. Her sister was shocked and assured me she would watch over her. One day she found out that I told her sister when she broke into her phone. She was very angry at me and started making insults and threatened me to end the friendship. Recently she is going to a psychologist and psychiatrist because her sister passed everything on to her parents. They are trying to help her but it doesn't really work so far. Also in the last 3 weeks her phone was taken by her parents because she wasn't doing her choirs and was always angry. In that time I only talked to her girlfriend in private on whatsapp, not in the group of us 3. And after a week she stole the phone for a moment from her parents and got furious at me saying I should not talk to her girl in a private chat. Only in the groupchat. I did so to stop it from getting worse. Talking for 3 weeks to her girlfriend was loads of fun. Silly texts, talk about all kinds of random stuff and I helped her with some questions on her homework. In those 3 weeks all of her grades went up. And she passed one exam after the other. It was amazing and she thought the same. 2 days ago she got her phone back and the first thing she said was that she was going to make a list of rules for me. If I don't obey those rules she will break the friendship. Some of those rules are: - Don't talk to my girlfriend in private - You are not allowed to visit my girlfriend if I'm not there too - Tell me everything that you are doing every day - If I'm busy talking with my girl, don't disturb us under any circumstances. I was really angry. I still am. I told her that I don't have any feelings for her girlfriend and that I would never do something to her on purpose. She just doesn't listen. Her girlfriend is also tired of her but she can't say no to her and she doesn't want to break up. I have some questions: - Is this normal? - Is it normal what she is doing? - What should her girlfriend do? - Did I do the right thing by telling her sister about her suicide thought, cutting, anxiety, demons and nightmares? It almost costed me my friendship with her."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post displays several emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes feeling overwhelmed by their friend's behavior and expresses concern for their well-being. They mention their friend's depression, self-harming behavior, and thoughts of suicide, as well as a belief in talking with a demon. This indicates a significant level of emotional distress and possible psychotic symptoms. The poster also mentions their own anger and frustration with the situation, which can be associated with depression. The overall tone of the post suggests a deep sense of worry, helplessness, and confusion, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""This is beyond messed up for me to think but I kind of just need to vent. I got a phone call this morning that my great uncle died last night. I cannot stand this man to begin with. He’s an addict, a liar, a thief, abuser, manipulator, convicted felon multiple times. He was attempting to run from the cops and he hit a telephone pole and he died. Im assuming he was DUI or picking up drugs. I’m not one bit surprised. In fact, I’m surprised he lived this long. He was given every resource and opportunity in the world and he fucked every single one of them up for the past 50+ years. He was one of those people who were better off just in jail so they can’t do harm to themselves, others, and the community. I cringed every time I saw him around. I couldn’t understand for the life of me why people put up with his shit and enable him. The same people who put up with him were the same ones who would complain and complain about him. My mom didn’t want my younger siblings around him.. we wouldn’t put it past him to do stuff to kids. I was so sick of hearing what Kenny did or tried to do. I feel absolutely horrible for my great grandfather who is 85 and is ALWAYS the one to clean up his mess. I feel bad for my great grandfather in the sense he has to burry his son and once again, clean up the mess that he has left. I may be the only person to not see this as a “loss”. No one has to sit around and worry, watch their things, wait around for a phone call that he’s either dead or in jail again. All of the bullshit just stops."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays a variety of emotions that are commonly associated with depression, such as anger, frustration, and a sense of hopelessness. The poster describes their negative feelings towards their great uncle, highlighting his negative traits and criminal behavior. These emotions are further exacerbated by the news of their great uncle's death. The mention of the poster's concern for their younger siblings' safety and their great grandfather's burden of cleaning up their great uncle's mess adds to the overall tone of distress and emotional strain. The post conveys a lack of empathy or connection to their great uncle's death, which can be a symptom of depression. Overall, the negative emotions, lack of empathy, and feeling overwhelmed by the situation align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""drugs are the only thing that make me feel okay i’ve done everything under the sun to try and help myself. counseling, confiding in anyone who will listen, taken all different types of medication, and the only thing that has ever made me feel okay is not being sober. idc what it is i’ll do it. i fucking hate being sober. i just want to get fucked up and lay in bed and watch shit on my laptop and i literally have no reason to be so depressed but the only thing that helps is drugs. not looking for moral support or anything i just need to vent without being looked down on and judged. thx"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a strong reliance on drugs as the only thing that provides relief or makes the poster feel okay. They mention trying various other methods such as counseling and medication, but none of them have been effective. The language used, such as ""fucking hate being sober"" and the desire to ""get fucked up,"" suggests a high level of frustration and desperation. The poster states that they have no reason to be depressed, indicating a potential disconnect between their emotional state and their perception of their life circumstances. The overall tone conveys a sense of hopelessness and a need for a non-judgmental outlet to vent, which align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""I think i'm okay, but in reality and in hindsight I am completely not okay. I think I am literally dying day by day. Hello to anyone out there, I'm just a good guy who didn't come from much and I'm trying my best to live a fulfilling life but I don't think I can anymore because of this illness. I use to be quite a geek as a kid and love video games and playing with others and having fun. I remember when I use to look forward to coming home from elementary school or middle school and just do my homework and then game away. It was so much fun then and I felt like I was genuinely pretty happy. Now a days I feel like i'm just literally dead. I don't do anything, I can't sleep, I hardly eat because I cant find the motivation to go out and get food... and over the past 4 years I have noticed that depression really has taken a toll on me mentally and physically. It sucks so bad that I genuinely think I will probably die prematurely and die lonely. I have no friends, no acquaintances, and just family that don't understand anything about what i'm going through. To be honest I wish I was never born. I wish i didn't exist because facing the world is killing me. Just the other day I thought about all the opportunities i've missed out on because of my depression. Like internships, jobs, career fairs, fun events and even a potential awesome friend but all of that isn't going to happen because i am as dead as a rock. I turned 22 a couple days ago and no one even said happy birthday...Not even family. At this point i'm looking at my future and its looking dim. I've simply lost the meaning of living. I have no self esteem, no confidence, nothing. Maybe people like me don't deserve to live a good life, perhaps we ought to die and just get over it. If there was someone who can tell me my fate i'll want to listen to it now. I just can't anymore. I fucking just want to run the bridge and jump off but sadly i recognize that I only have one life. I'm hoping and hoping maybe everything can turn around for me but what are the odds to be honest. I might as well have a heart attack and just die. I hate this. I'm lonely, i'm always sad and i'm just a piece of shit that is worthless. Good Bye everyone. I hope you've all had an awesome day. As for me everyday is the same and if things don't change soon I think i'll rather end it. Not even graduating college meant anything for me. I fucking hate myself!"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain, despair, hopelessness, and self-loathing. The poster describes feeling completely not okay and experiencing a decline in mental and physical health over the past four years. They express a lack of motivation, loss of enjoyment in activities they used to love, and difficulty with basic daily tasks like sleeping and eating. The mention of feeling lonely, having no friends or support system, and thoughts of not deserving to live or wanting to end their life indicate a severe level of emotional distress consistent with symptoms of very severe depression. The overall tone of the post is overwhelmingly negative, with a strong sense of resignation and self-hatred, suggesting a serious mental health issue."
"Consider this post: ""Helping a girlfriend with depression possibly? Hello, I want to first off say this is a throwaway. I also looked for similar post regarding what I will ask, but i really want a tailored answer for my own sanity. Sorry for being selfish, this is just hard. I have been dating this girl for almost a year and I know she has been slipping into an abyss of what I cannot diagnose, but seems like depression. I will start with a time table. We began dating after meeting on a popular dating app and we hit it off fast. Similar interest, goals, outlooks, expectations, and lifestyle. We became extremely close with in two months and then out of the blue she tells me its over. I didn't feel it was a justifiable way to end the relationship. I contacted her and we had long winded email correspondence with in which she had this quote to me "" I feel lost at work, lost in my personal life, and just lost with trying to find my happiness. You do make me happier. And idk what just snapped last week but I was super depressed all week ."" I talked with her and we set small goals to rekindle and help her find her happiness. We got back together with in two weeks and that started a prolonged honeymoon period for which we traveled, went on ski trips, took our dogs on hikes, and generally enjoyed ourselves. This continued until march or 2018, when I noticed her slipping back in to her just overall never satisfied state. I got worried and tried to lightly push her to no avail. I then tried to make plans at least twice a month to help distract her and give her a solid thing to look forward to. She never changed and just got worse to the point where the last 2 months, she gets home from work smokes enough weed to put me to sleep, eats too much and then goes to sleep by 9. I tried to encourage by proxy by going to the gym and going to parks with her dog and taking pictures and even getting closer with her family. nothing worked. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, she went to Sweden on a vacation with her best friend and had a blast and was calling me everyday so happy and excited. I thought we had a legitimate break through. Then one week before she returns i start to only get 1 or 2 text a day, I figure she is living her best life to busy with international travel to communicate regularly like she requested. She returns and we spend one night together and she calls me at school to come over to her place asap. she dumps me with little to no explanation. I met with her once more to voice my opinion and she was just quiet and had nothing to say but sorry and that i deserve someone who loves me like Love her. Today she starts emailing me about how she just needs space and she wants me to still talk to her family. I really do not know what to think... My friends say fuck her move on. I have never had a connection or love for someone outside my family and I have had at least 3 relationships over 2 years (I am almost 30). This one really felt different, the way she looked in my eyes and the way we talked about all our joint desires, just felt so good. I just want everyone to know I am open to honest responses and please feel free to speak openly, I just hurt because I feel like this is when she needs me most, but also might just need her own time to figure her self out. Thank you for your time and help. Cheers, Your Reddit friend."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post strongly indicates that the poster's girlfriend is experiencing depression. The poster describes their girlfriend slipping ""into an abyss of what I cannot diagnose, but seems like depression"" and mentions her feeling lost and depressed.

I had friends that would try to help me but idk if they just got sick of me not getting any better or if I was a bad friend or what... I’m only 17 but I’ve felt this meaninglessness since I was eight. It’s one of the few things I even remember from back then.

"Consider this post: ""I can't forgive her, no matter how hard I try I'm focusing on improving myself and working through repressed emotions from a difficult upbringing, namely with my grandmother. I am currently staying with her but thankfully I am already making plans and taking steps to move out within the next 5 months or so. I have stayed on and off the last several years and before I became an adult, I lived with her from birth. We have a complicated relationship. Although I appreciate the things she has done for me - and she often tries to make me happy by buying me something or getting me food I like, etc. - I can't seem to let go of the deep seated anger and resentment I feel toward her for the mistakes she has made and how she has also been cruel to me. I understand no one is perfect; adults aren't always ideal role models to kids. But my grandmother had a unique way of mentally and emotionally hurting me as a child. She would often act like I was her partner in crime [in the absence of a husband] and made me feel responsible for her happiness. She would try to talk bad about my mom so I wouldn't favor her [my mom wasn't living with us and had mental issues]. She would give me the cold shoulder, or say things to incite anxiety and guilt in me if I happened to act like I wanted to spend more time with my mom or got in a bad mood. It confuses me because I think deep in my heart I DO want a happy relationship with her...or maybe I try so hard out of guilt, knowing she has tried to make it up to me, I guess? But every so often I implode and I tell her how much she bothers me or even that I hate her. Sometimes even hearing the sound of her voice is enough to make me want to scream in irritation. I feel terrible about it and like I'm a monster. I always feel guilty when she tells me 'you're the only one who is really special to me, you're the only one I have.' [She doesn't have a close relationship with mom, her other D, or siblings.] Maybe I get angry because to me, this doesn't feel normal, it feels like I'm being trapped. I'm seeing a DBT therapist but we aren't making progress about this ... yet. I just wish this was not my life. I'm not looking for solutions per say, just sympathy or someone who also understands. It's so exhausting."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses deep-seated anger, resentment, and guilt towards their grandmother, along with feelings of being trapped and exhausted. They describe a complicated relationship and how their grandmother emotionally hurt them as a child. The mention of feeling like a monster and wanting to scream in irritation demonstrates a high level of emotional distress. The poster also mentions seeing a therapist but not making progress, indicating a prolonged struggle with their emotional state. Overall, the post conveys a sense of hopelessness, emotional pain, and exhaustion that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""Need honest opinions on my living situation. So about 6 months ago, my father had an accident which left him disabled. He lived in a 1 story ranch home. Being the only child that would be able to take care of my Dad, I moved my husband and 2 children to my dads house. Our house needed so much work, we wanted to sell it anyways, his house being 1 level worked so much better for him, allowed him to get around easier. So my father has gotten a little better, can take care of himself in the bathroom, needs helps with cleaning, cooking etc. also can’t drive. We are still living with my dad. The living situation has really worked out for us all. I am a stay at home mom, so taking care of my dad and 2 children is very much manageable. My husband and I do have our own space in the house as well. Sooo can someone please tell me why I’m so embarrassed to tell people of our living situation? Everyone knows what happened to my dad, everyone knows he needs me but I sort of feel like a failure. I guess because we don’t own our own house. We have done so much work and updating to my fathers house to make it our own. We pay almost all of the bills too. I love that we are all together I’m just sick of telling the whole story of how my dad got hurt and why I had to move in with him and why we don’t own our own house. My husband and I want to add an addition onto the house, we just renovated and finished the basement. We are happy, I just can’t get over being embarrassed. Thoughts y’all?!"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster primarily discusses their living situation, expressing a sense of embarrassment and frustration when it comes to explaining it to others. While there may be underlying feelings of self-doubt and insecurities, the overall tone of the post is not overwhelmingly negative or despairing. The poster also states that they are happy with their current situation and have plans for further improvements, which suggests a level of contentment and hopefulness that is not commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""I haven't felt anything in over a month. I have struggled with depression for a few years now, and I was doing really well. I met a girl online that seemed absolutely perfect, and she made me feel truly happy for the first time since I was little. In October, she just stopped replying to me. She sent a message a few weeks later faking to be a family member and lied about committing suicide. I just feel nothing anymore after that."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a lack of emotions and a sense of numbness that has lasted for over a month. The poster mentions struggling with depression in the past and finding happiness through a new relationship. However, the relationship abruptly ended with the girl pretending to commit suicide. This traumatic event has had a profound impact on the poster's emotional state, resulting in a complete loss of feeling. The combination of preexisting depression, the sudden loss of a significant source of happiness, and the traumatic experience of being deceived and lied to contribute to the likelihood of the poster suffering from depression."
"Consider this post: ""Shoudl I just stop being friends with this guy? I made a post on this subreddit a couple days ago. I thought that all my friends disliked me because I am mean to them, but for a solid 2-3 days I was the nicest I had been to anyone for what I remember, I asked all my friends how their days were, bought them food, listened to them. And it worked, they all are my very good friends now, but there is just one problem, the person who I considered my BEST friend is being a dick. Once I get attached to someone it’s hard for me to let go. For example, in my previous relationship, I hated my gf, and I hated being with her, talking to her, I found her annoying, I never broke up with her, then, one day she decidedI was neglecting her so she said she wanted to break up, I begged her to stay even though I hated everything about her. We still end up breaking up, afterwards I was soo happy. Now, this person who I considered to be my BEST friend makes fun of me all the time for getting dumped by a girl and saying “you got left by an ugly girl for a gay guy.” This sentence aline can tell you about his personality and how bad of a person he is. Today, my scho went to a ski park, I enjoyed my day, had fun, everythkng was fine. On the bus ride back to school, I was talking to my so called “best friend.” He randomly went up to a girl I didn’t know and told her I liked her, she then said “I don’t care.” I don’t know if this was a rejection or just a simple “I don’t care” but I didn’t really care because I didn’t find her attractive at all. I laugh it off and end up saying the word “nigga.” Now, I am what you would call a mulatto. I am bi-racial, half black, half white. After I said this word, a girl sitting behind me called me a racist. I then say that i’m half black and she says “I know.” This was embarrassing, I get made fun of a lot because of the tone of my skin and my ethnicity, it’s one if the things that still get to me. Moving on, he proceeds to point at me and laugh, then, scream at me saying I got rejected by the girl I didn’t even like or ask out. I stood up on the bus and accidentally touched a girl’s tit, she got very mad and I apologized but you could tell she was still mad. We get to school and he starts pushing me into doors and lockers, he is much bigger than me and I couldn’t really push him back easily. The day ends then we take the bus back home, me and this kid are on the same bus and he says, “you’re gross, nobody likes you and you got rejected by the ugliest girl in school. That’s why you got dumped by an ugly bitch.” And he walked away, as i’m walking home, I was talking to some friends and they treat me like a fucking human, they were nice, didn’t insult me, and treated me nicely. I got home and here I an, what should I do, he has managed to get the whole school to believe I am a perv, racist, ugly, nobody. It’s actually funny, he was the first person to ever talk to me, he was nice to me but after a while it just turned out he was a bad person, I wish one of the other guys were first to approach me, i’d have much better friends. What do I do, it’s one one of the hardest things to dispel gossip, everybody thought I was gay when I first came to the school, I got a girlfriend, suspicion gone, but how am I gunna disprove im not racist, not a perv, and how the hell am I supposed to deal with this “friend” if mine?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post presents a clear emotional distress due to the interactions with the supposed ""best friend."" The poster describes feelings of attachment and difficulty letting go, similar to their previous relationship. They express hurt and frustration towards their friend's insensitive and hurtful behavior, which includes making fun of them and spreading rumors. The mention of being made fun of based on their race and ethnicity also indicates a level of emotional distress and potential impact on their self-esteem. Overall, the post reveals significant emotional turmoil and negative experiences in relationships, suggesting a potential presence of depression."
"Consider this post: ""My best is not enough. Ok, so here is the situation: I broke up with my ex five months ago. As soon as we ended our thing, I started running everyday, eating healthy food only, and going to the gym. 1h30min of HEAVY exercise everyday. I did this until this very day. I lost fucking 15kg (my weight at the start was 90kg, now 75kg). I also bought green contact lenses to wear, and even sunbathe. I invested so much time (and money) to improve myself and look amazing and no. one. noticed.! I look at the mirror and I am happy with my results. Then, the moment I exit my house:BOOM. 4 months thrown into the trash. No one cares. It makes no difference. The women I'm attracted still do not find me attractive. It pisses me off how I imagine they won't survive just one week of my training. They can't see how hard I worked to change. I downloaded Tinder,even saw my EX there, wrote a BIO describing myself (I still find myself interesting. People, don't) and I got nearly 0 matches. Now I'm stuck in an Alcohol /Cigarette/Party/OneNightStandGirls loop and I can't get out of it. I drink so much that I can't even remember some things. I have fun, yes. But I want to have a connection with someone again. Is it asking too much? Why people don't give a chance to know me???"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of emotional distress and dissatisfaction. The poster describes putting significant effort into self-improvement, both physically and mentally, but expresses frustration that no one is noticing or appreciating their efforts. They also mention resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as excessive alcohol and cigarette use, as well as engaging in casual relationships to fill the void. The overall tone of the post indicates a deep longing for connection and a sense of rejection or isolation. These feelings align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, particularly the feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and desperation for genuine human connection."
"Consider this post: ""Close friend suddenly turned cold I have a friend who's had some mental and anxiety issues in the past. We generally chat online, although we've met up in real life a number of times, and talk on the phone sporadically. They have an issue with trust. They believe no one cares about them and that every friend they have will eventually leave them. So fairly insecure. They are currently attending therapy (have for a number of months) to help them with their anxiety. They are meditating etc. At a certain point I stepped up and decided, 'Okay, if they truly believe this about themselves, that people always leave them, I'm going to be the person who doesn't.' For the record, I know of a mutual friend who did push this person randomly out of their life—so as far as I know, it's not a lie. Anyway, I stepped up because I thought this person was pretty special and intelligent. I loved that they were passionate and outspoken and unique. Over time, I developed some feelings for them too but more a great love as a friend than anything too romantic. Anyhow, we grew close. We shared many things, pretty much every day, although I believe she feared that she was abusing the friendship because I would try and reassure her a lot. She asked for my advice, and I gave it without thought. When she was upset, I tried my best to calm her down and express care. When she needed a boost, I gave it to her. She was worth my time. And she did the same for me. Because she was going through a hard time in general, I did all this because she was who she was. Then...we had a couple of fights. Nothing horrible, and we supposedly worked through our problems but...I've been having my own issues recently. After the last fight, where we talked everything out on the phone and she expressed the qualities she liked about me, as a friend, and how she was afraid that doing so in the past had pushed people away...well. Now, she's cold and distant. Not 100%, but there's something sincerely off, enough to notice. Phrasing that you wouldn’t use with a friend, let alone an acquaintance. I have years and years of examples to the contrary and I’ve asked a therapist friend to have a look at the differences as well. She’s definitely changed; it's definitely not just me. Supposedly, she’s looking after her mental health. I can see how having a person there to always reassure them may lead to this person not being as eager or able to rely on themselves, but we could have worked this out. I would have supported them through it. My support was enough up until three weeks ago when something quite major occurred and upset them. Now, I get ‘Well, I suppose that’s very kind of you’ when I express concern for how she is and ‘How do I know that you’re not rolling your eyes?’ when I express that I care and ‘What possible use could I be to you’ when I tried to give her a little advice and express that she's important to me too. These are all usual parts of the conversation and nothing out of the ordinary from my side. Her manner and actions are a huge backflip, because less than a month ago she expressed how important and vital my friendship was to her because she—definitively—knew I cared about her (and suspected others didn’t). She also stated that she was going to be a better friend. Now I hear ‘I need balance in my life’, as if it was a major issue to be close to someone. The two things—better mental health/developing more of an ability to take care of oneself *and* having someone close to confide in—are not mutually exclusive. I’ve lost a decent amount of sleep over this because the support was reciprocal, so it feels like I've lost a large part of my support network. I’m looking for any opinions on what I should do here, because I’m hurting and it’s already been a bad time (of which this person is aware). I've already asked them twice what's up and the question has been turned on me both times, as if I'm the one with the issue. I don't want to cut them off because they really do mean a hell of a lot to me, but is that all I can do here? I've tried to just back way off for the moment and see if they realise what they've done on their own. P.S. This is a six-year"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post reveals a deep sense of emotional pain and distress, as well as a strong attachment to the friend who has become distant. The poster expresses feelings of hurt, confusion, and a sense of loss. They mention losing sleep over the situation and feeling like they've lost a part of their support network. These emotions are indicative of the profound sadness and despair commonly associated with depression. However, it should be noted that the post does not provide enough information to definitively determine whether the poster suffers from depression or if their emotions are solely a result of the situation with their friend. Further context and information would be needed for a more accurate assessment."
"Consider this post: ""I'm having trouble getting along with someone I want to consider a friend Long story short: This guy was originally a friend of a friend, I'll call him Jeff. We all go to the same college and have the same mutual friends. Jeff and I got along pretty well for a bit but recently all he does is piss me off While I get the whole ""friends mess with each other"" idea, but it just doesn't fly with me and this guy. I may mess around with my friends once in a while and I'm a big joker, but for the most part I just like to have a good time together whenever we do anything whether we play video games, go to the gym, etc. On the other hand, it feels that Jeff goes out of the way to piss me off no matter what we do because he KNOWS it will piss me off. I know typically you want to show no reaction to this kind of thing to avoid fanning the flames but I can't help it I don't know how to deal with him or get the message across. When I tried to sit down with him and talk man to man, Jeff didn't seem to take me seriously and kept going ahead with his previous antics. I talked with our other friends (who have known him longer than I) and they all just told me something along the lines of: ""he doesn't mean anything by it, it's just how he is don't get offended"". But unfortunately, we don't mix that way. Now Jeff's not inherently a bad person, when he's serious he's actually a pretty good guy. He has helped me out in some tough binds before and has done so for the other guys too, all of which I greatly appreciate. But his behavior to me on a day to day basis just really really pisses me off"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not indicate a presence of depression. The main issue discussed in the post is the difficulty in getting along with someone who is considered a friend. While the poster expresses frustration and annoyance with this individual's behavior, there are no strong indicators of emotional distress, hopelessness, or a lack of enjoyment in general activities. The tone of the post seems to be more focused on seeking advice and solutions for improving the relationship with the problematic friend rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""Recovering from an abusive ex So I’ve stopped seeing a guy who was emotionally manipulative and abusive towards me. Honestly I feel so alone and hopeless.

I feel so damage beyond repair and like I’ve got no one to help me get through this difficult period."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster has recently ended a relationship with an emotionally manipulative and abusive person. They express feelings of loneliness, hopelessness, and believing negative things said about them. They feel damaged beyond repair and lacking support.

"Consider this post: ""[F17] I really need someone to listen This is a throw-away, because I don't want anyone in my personal life to see this. Let me preface this by saying I've been diagnosed with bipolar tendencies (i guess you can't diagnose bipolar disorder until you're 18), severe depression, chronic anxiety and body dysmorphia. I've been hospitalized for a suicide attempt almost two years ago, and I've struggled with self harm since fourth grade. I was bullied relentlessly throughout elementary and middle school. Thankfully, i've been clean for a year, and after the hospital I got on medication and things started to get better for a while. My senior year has been great so far but it's starting to get bad again. I used to be a social smoker, but now I'm completely dependent on marijuana for everything. I'm not hungry unless I smoke and I can't fall asleep unless I smoke. I need it to get through the day. I can't go to college, because I can't afford it and my mom says she can't consign on a loan for me. I totally understand that too, because if my dad were to die she'd be in trouble and in tens of thousands of dollars in debt. I'm just sad because I want to go away like all of my friends but I can't. My dad is most likely going to lose his job soon apparently too, which is going to put us in poverty. My mom and dad fight all the time, and hate each other. They've both talked about getting a divorce to me exclusively. I pretend like it doesn't bother me, but it does. My dad is addicted to prescription painkillers, and locks himself in his room the minute he gets home. He comes to my choir concerts, plays, and musicals but leaves almost immediately after it starts, which hurts me a lot. I pretend like I don't care about that either. The thing that hurts me the most now is my dog was put down today. She was my first dog. I was allergic to dogs when I was way younger. I grew out of it and it took so long to find her, because my mom was set on picking the perfect dog for us. We found her, and now she's gone. I was the one who stayed in the room with her, because my mom couldn't do it. I pet and comforted her while she died. I've never had to cope with someone dying before, and it's so hard. She was just a dog, but I still loved her so much. I want her back so bad. My problems are so minor compared to some people's, but I'm so sad right now. I don't know what to do. This is the first time in a while that I've wanted to kill myself, but I don't want to go down that road again. I just don't know how to cope anymore."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain, despair, and hopelessness. The poster describes a history of mental health diagnoses including severe depression, bipolar tendencies, chronic anxiety, and body dysmorphia. They express a long history of struggling with self-harm and a previous suicide attempt. The mention of being clean for a year and being on medication indicates some improvement, but the poster describes a recent decline in their mental health. They also discuss unhealthy coping mechanisms such as dependency on marijuana and express feelings of sadness and frustration about not being able to afford college and feeling trapped in their current situation. The mention of their parents' conflicts, potential job loss, and addiction issues adds to their overall emotional distress. The loss of their dog and their difficulty coping with death further contributes to their profound emotional pain. The post exhibits many symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression, including thoughts of suicide and a sense of hopelessness and lack of coping mechanisms."
"Consider this post: ""isnt it kind of crazy when people who actually are not clinically depressed say they want to die or are depressed for fun, when you are really dealing with those feelings for real? There are people at my work place who clearly are not clinically depressed but tag and share memes like they are lonely or depressed or just say they want to die in a funny way, when everyday is a huge challenge for me in terms of forcing myself to be alive and conform to the societal norms. This usually never gets to me because many people dont actually get what it means to be depressed. Even depressed people experience things in a spectrum. However, when I feel like I am falling off the wagon and I see these seemingly normal treat suicidal thoughts/coping mechanisms of genuinely depressed people/melancholy as fun memes and have a good laugh when all those things are part my own personal hell, I just go completely bonkers and I do not really know why. Anyone else feel like this ? Sorry for terrible punctuation."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses frustration and anger towards people who joke or make light of depression, highlighting the stark contrast between their own personal experiences of daily struggle and the casual treatment of depressive thoughts and coping mechanisms as fun or funny. The mention of feeling like they are falling off the wagon and going completely bonkers suggests a significant level of emotional distress and a potential lack of coping mechanisms. The poster also acknowledges that even within the depressed community, experiences vary, indicating an awareness of the complexity of depression. Overall, the post conveys a deep sense of pain, isolation, and frustration that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""It's so much easier to fall back in than to fight against it"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster is experiencing a struggle or conflict. The phrase ""fall back in"" implies a temptation or pull towards something negative or harmful. This can be interpreted as a reference to depressive thoughts or behaviors. The statement ""easier to fall back in than to fight against it"" suggests a sense of resignation or feeling overwhelmed by the effort required to resist negative emotions or behaviors. This aligns with the characteristic of depression where individuals may feel trapped or powerless in the face of their difficulties."
"Consider this post: ""Just found out my mum is pregnant. Advice on big age gaps between siblings would be appreciated. I have two younger sisters, and we're all really close in age (my youngest sister is 3 years younger than me), but I'm turning 20 this year. So this new baby will be 20 years younger than me. I'm not sure how to feel. My sisters and I are fairly close, and I'm worried that we won't be able to bond with our new sibling because of the huge age difference. We'll probably have all moved out in a few years (I've been planning on moving out this year) so we won't even get to have time to make those connections like we did with each other. It's just that it doesn't even feel real to me yet. Like if I was told that a relative or family friend was pregnant, not my own mother. If anyone has any advice or experience with something like this I would be really grateful to hear it. Thank you."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses concern and uncertainty about the significant age gap between the poster and their future sibling. There is a sense of worry about the potential impact this age difference may have on their ability to bond and connect with the new baby. However, there is no indication of intense emotional distress, hopelessness, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. The tone of the post is more reflective and seeking advice rather than conveying a deep sense of emotional pain. Therefore, it does not align with the symptoms of depression."
"Consider this post: ""Ancestry.com - is it safe? Hello!: ) I'm a new user so if this post ends up in a weird place/thread, pls bear w me. Has anyone used Ancestry.com lately? They offer a two week trial but still require your credit card information. Is this suspicious? It doesn't cost anything for the first two weeks, and then you can end the trial so you don't have to pay anything even then, but I just feel a little uncomfortable dialing my credit card information on there online.... Am I being too doubtfull? Share your experiences? Thank you! If my English isn't perfect, that's because I'm not a native speaker."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of depression. It primarily focuses on a specific concern regarding the safety of using Ancestry.com and asking for advice and experiences from other users. While there is a slight hint of uncertainty or doubt, it does not prominently display the profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with depression. The tone of the post seems more pragmatic and seeking information rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress. Additionally, the mention of being a non-native English speaker suggests that any imperfections in the writing could be attributed to language fluency rather than emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""Friend is acting distant, not hanging out much, i don't know what to do. *Apologies ahead of time for the novel.* So i (M 30s) have been friends with my buddy (M 30s) for several years, and there seems to be a repeating pattern with him and i really don't know what to do when this happens. Instead of a long history, i'll just cite these last few months as an example. So as i said, we've known each other for quite a while. He's probably my best friend, although i wouldn't say i'm his (i'm not sure he really has one). But anyways, prior to the last couple months we were hanging out as we usually do. If we don't hang out every other day, we'd usually catch up over voice chat while playing video games, etc... And this is the normal routine for us, we'd talk or hang out at least every other day, if not more often. Then suddenly, a few weeks ago, it's like a switch went off and he's out. What i mean by that is since then, i may hear from him once a week for an hour or so, at best; sometimes longer. When we do chat, he mostly seems normal, but i can tell he's off. So i've asked him what he's been up to, what's going on in his life, you know the usuals, and i get the usual answers for him: work, playing video games, seeing his parents occasionally. I've brought up his absence and asked him what's going on, and his answer is usually the standard runaround, ""oh nothing"", ""i've just been avoiding everyone"", ""just doing my own thing"". I pressed a little harder a couple weeks back and got a jokingly put ""i guess i've got a serotonin imbalance, haha"". I could sense his desire not to talk about it (which he never does, he hates discussing anything feelings related), so i let it go. Next time we spoke, i brought it up again, asked him how he was doing with his issues, and got the usual ""meh"" or ""i dunno"". When i asked what i could do to help him, he answered, ""you can stop fucking asking me about it"", so i of course let it go, and our convo continued as if there were no problems. But of course there are, he's still MIA for weeks at a time. The thing is, this is a pattern with him. We're normal buddies, seeing/chatting all the time for months, and then WHAM, he's out and like this for weeks or a few months. Then as if another switch goes off, he's back on again and acts normal and as if nothing's happened. This has happened more times than i can count. You know i wouldn't be so concerned if he were actually busy with life and doing things, but as he tells it in his own words when i do see him, he's doing nothing out of the ordinary (which for him is work and sitting home every night by himself (lives alone) playing video games (something we usually do together). But as far as i can tell he's just sitting alone by himself every night. I've considered the possibility he's depressed or bi-polar (although you'd never get him to admit that), in which case i don't know what to do if he won't talk to me about it. I've considered that perhaps i've done something to make him angry, but when he does come around (if i'm not bringing up this issue), he acts completely normal and we laugh and cut up, and whatnot like nothings wrong. I've thought perhaps he's just not interested in being friends anymore, but he does still come around, and as i've said, after one of these episodes for a few weeks/months it's as if nothing's happened at all. So my problem is this. I don't know what to do when he's like this. I don't know how to act, what to say, how to approach him, etc. You know, he's my best friend, i'd like to be there for him, to help if i can, but he rebuffs any attempt on my part to find out what's really going on, well besides him just ""avoiding everyone right now, and doing my own thing"". He gets agitated if i push the issue. So how do i handle this? Is there a way to broach this"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does exhibit emotional indicators that suggest the poster may be experiencing some level of depression. The poster describes feeling confused and unsure about how to handle their friend's behavior, which suggests a sense of helplessness or being overwhelmed. The mention of their friend's avoidance of discussing feelings and their own openness about their own emotions suggests a contrast in coping mechanisms, potentially indicating a deeper emotional struggle for the poster. The overall tone of the post conveys a sense of concern and frustration, as well as a fear of pushing their friend further away, which aligns with the emotional distress commonly associated with depression. However, without additional information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the depression or provide a definitive label."
"Consider this post: ""today is my birthday :) Today is my birthday. 8th alone. 22 today, a number that i never would've thought i would reach. I bought some of my favorite snacks and got my old blanket, just going to watch some of my favorite movies today. I also bought a card for myself ( which i do every year) , written on it was ""Happy Birthday, Love mum and dad""... they were the last people to ever tell that to me and i know that even tho its been over a decade since they're gone, they were the last people to celebrate and be happy because of me, the last people to love me. i miss them so much.

Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of loneliness, longing, and grief. The poster expresses a strong connection to their parents who are no longer alive and describes feeling lonely and struggling to cope, especially in the last few months. Despite it being their birthday, they emphasize the absence of their parents and the longing to spend more time with them. The mention of feeling alone and struggling to cope indicates emotional distress and potential symptoms of depression. However, it is worth noting that the post also includes edits expressing gratitude and appreciation for the support received, suggesting some positive emotions and a sense of temporary happiness. Overall, the post leans towards indicating the presence of depression due to the profound feelings of loneliness and grief."
"Consider this post: ""Sometimes, I stand in front of the mirror and think ""why would anyone ever love you?"" Why is it so hard for people to accept me?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post reflects self-doubt, a negative self-image, and a feeling of rejection. Standing in front of the mirror and questioning one's worthiness of love suggests low self-esteem and negative self-perception, which are commonly associated with depression. The statement about struggling with acceptance also implies a sense of isolation and potential difficulty in forming and maintaining relationships, which can be indicators of depression. Overall, the post conveys emotional distress and negative thoughts about oneself, aligning with symptoms commonly seen in depression."

In last year of high school but my grades are horrible, Im MISERABLE at my job but cant quit due to the pay, I completely lack a social life and girlfriend, and have so little motovation I feel like I will flunk out of college if I go. I was going to go to talk to my psychiatrist that does medication management for ADD when I went to see her the other day. I literally couldnt suck up the pride to tell her I was depressed and need a psychologist referal. She even asked how my moods were and I said they were just fine. I feel weird just meeting a random psychologist and dont know how to find a good one. Being a guy I have just sucked it up for the last 5 year and I feel weak for needing help, and even with me telling myself I need help I keep thinking every psychologist listing i see isnt good enough and keep pushing it off like I have for a LONG time. My life is a MISERABLE cycle of depression that I cant seem to get out of. I NEED help but I literally dont know how I can get myself to suck up the pride and go to a psychologist."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post demonstrates several indicators of depression. The poster expresses feeling depressed since their early teens and describes their current circumstances as a ""cycle of depression."" They express feelings of misery, lack of motivation, and a sense of being stuck in their current job and education situation. The individual also mentions lacking a social life and a girlfriend, which can contribute to feelings of isolation and further exacerbate depressive symptoms. The post reveals a struggle with opening up about their depression, as they mention not being able to tell their psychiatrist and feeling ashamed for needing help. The overall tone of hopelessness, self-criticism, and the desire for help but difficulty in seeking it aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."

Reasoning: The post exhibits a clear sense of longing for the past and dissatisfaction with the current state of the poster's life. They express feelings of being lost, pathetic, and regretful. They mention missing the enjoyment of activities like clubbing, spending time with friends, and having a romantic relationship. The mention of studying all day and losing friends suggests a lack of social connection and fulfillment in their current life. The use of strong language (""pathetic,"" ""regret,"" ""fucking regret every last second"") conveys intense negative emotions and self-criticism. Overall, the post displays emotional distress, dissatisfaction, and a sense of hopelessness, which align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Should I still communicate with my father? Hello everyone. So the past few days my mom caught my dad cheating on her (2 women specifically). Now my mom sent him a closure to cut the ties (we live on the US while my dad is on another country). I'm angry and familiar with this feeling as well because my previous girlfriend cheated on me too (I guess it runs on the blood to be cheated on). Right now I don't know if I should cut my ties as well, as I can't forgive someone who broke my mom's heart and also someone who can't be contented at all. I'm 24 and take full responsibility on her. Our little family is all what my mom have, as she never worked her whole life and expended it to nurture us her children, giving up her career and dreams."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster exhibits signs of depression. The post mentions feelings of anger and familiarity with the feeling of being cheated on, which suggests unresolved emotional pain from past experiences. The poster expresses uncertainty about whether to cut ties with their father, indicating a struggle with their emotions and potential feelings of guilt or responsibility.

"Consider this post: ""extreme sadness whenever seeing anything happy Hello, this has been bothering me for a while and i have no idea what is this but when i ever i read or see anything happy like a happy scene or a happy story from some random comment i feel a huge wave of sadness wash over me and i feel like crying, why? what is going on? (i am not sure if this belongs to here but if not i don't mind it being deleted and sorry for breaking rules.)"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a feeling of extreme sadness and a significant emotional reaction to anything happy. The poster describes experiencing a wave of sadness and feeling like crying when encountering positive or happy content. This intense emotional response to happiness is not typical and may indicate a symptom of depression called anhedonia, which is the inability to feel pleasure or joy. This emotional state aligns with the symptoms commonly associated with depression, particularly anhedonia and heightened sensitivity to positive stimuli, suggesting that the poster may be suffering from depression."
"Consider this post: ""I get depressed, so I procrastinate, so I get more depressed, etc. I hate my job with a burning passion but I can't bring myself to quit or do anything else. My job is ""prestigious"" and high-paying so it's the only thing that makes me look successful to family and friends, which makes it the only tiny source of self-worth I have. If I lost my job, everyone would know the useless, depressed piece of shit I really am. I fucking despise my job though, so I can't bring myself to actually do the work. I procrastinate for hours/days and only get anything done by pulling all-nighters right before deadlines. I could have an assignment for two weeks and I will still do it from 2:00 am to 7:00 am the night before it's due. The procrastination makes me even more depressed, anxious, stressed, etc., which makes me even less interested in doing my work. I know I would be less miserable if I got my shit together, but I just can't make myself do it, and then I hate myself even more. Vicious cycle continues. I've tried every trick in the book to stop procrastinating but nothing works. Anyone else deal with this?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post reflects a deep sense of self-hatred, despair, and hopelessness. The poster expresses feeling trapped in a job they hate but cannot leave due to the external validation it provides. They also describe a cycle of procrastination that exacerbates their depression and further diminishes their self-worth. The mention of trying various strategies to stop procrastinating without success highlights a prolonged struggle with their mental state. The overall tone conveys a significant level of emotional distress and aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""I did something that made me really happy. After flunking a test, getting yelled at by a classmate. sitting alone at lunch with incredible anxiety and spilling milk on my uniform and having to go thru an hour long commute in a really hot day i get home feeling really overwhelmed with tons of homework i remember feeling very numb at the time that I just decided to turn off all the lights in my dorm and got completely naked and played my ukelele. i played my favourite song and started crying and just sang at the top of my lungs sounding like a dying whale and it lasted for like 2 hours i could feel every bit of depression and anxiety slowly leak off my body until the water bill knocked on my door."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a series of negative experiences, including failing a test, being yelled at, feeling anxious, and making a mess. The poster describes feeling overwhelmed, numb, and experiencing anxiety. However, there is a shift in the post when the poster mentions doing something that made them happy. They describe playing their favorite song on the ukelele and crying for two hours, which they feel helped them release their depression and anxiety.

"Consider this post: ""Does anyone want to just exchange some compliments? Hey! I know a lot of you are having a rough time out there, and some of you are having one of those nights where things aren't looking too good. I'm having one of those right now. I think we can all benefit from just a session of telling each other the truth, that we all matter. We are all beautiful. We are all worth it. I'm going to post this and go to sleep, but I promise you all that I will respond to each and every person who comments when I wake up. I love you guys! Feel free to start without me :p"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of emotional vulnerability and a desire for connection and validation from others. The poster acknowledges that they are having a rough time and offers to exchange compliments with others who may also be struggling. The mention of feeling like things aren't looking too good and the promise to respond to each and every person who comments suggests a personal need for emotional support and affirmation. While this post may not indicate very severe depression, it does show signs of seeking validation and connection, which can be indicative of depression."
"Consider this post: ""Feeling good about helping people Does anyone else here ever feel better about themselves when you're able to offer a little help or guidance to someone off the street you don't know? As an example, sometime last month I was having a pretty meh day, just... Not feeling the worst ever, but not feeling very good either, when on my way home I happened to find an iPhone sitting on a grate outside the subway station. I picked it up and looked around for the owner, then after entering the station found a couple of young women searching their bags and I asked if the phone was theirs. It was, and they said ""thank you so much!"" And I felt really happy that I'd been able to help them, like, I just kinda decided right then to forget about my problems, because, I'd helped someone. Like, maybe those two would have never found their phone if I hadn't come along. I mean they probably would have, but, y'know. I felt like I'd been helpful in a real small but meaningful way and that felt good. I really like helping people, but I usually get upset when I try to help people I actually know personally, because, well, people don't always want help with more personal issues, or even with simple issues from people they know well, and trying to tell when to help or not is just really complicated. Like, I'll just real nicely try to suggest a solution to a problem, or simply offering some consolation, and instead of, I dunno, actually trying it or telling me patiently why that isn't a good idea, they just rail on me and tell me to shut up or whatever. And I just feel like, jeez, what'd I do? I'm trying to help here... And I always get real upset about that and doubt myself over it, like, am I doing a bad thing by trying to be nice? I know that's not true, I get sometimes people want to figure things out on their own, or I guess you don't like my attitude or blablabla, but, I dunno, you can't maybe acknowledge that I'm trying to do good? But in a situation where it's just strangers, trying to find their way, cross the street, lost a thing or whatever, it's easy to tell when they need help, because everything's a lot more straightforward, if that makes sense. If someone needs help, it's usually pretty obvious and they're almost always pretty receptive to help, and, provided you just look like a normal person, they don't judge. No biases or baggage over past interactions or whatever, they're just happy to have help. So yeah I guess this is a little longer than it needs to be, but, yeah. Helping random people feels good and distracts from my depression a little. Is what I was saying. Anyone else feel this way?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a mixture of positive emotions related to helping others and a sense of personal fulfillment and happiness derived from those experiences. The poster describes feeling uplifted and distracted from their depression when they are able to offer help or guidance to strangers. Although there is a mention of feeling upset and doubting themselves when trying to help people they know personally, this does not overshadow the overall positive emotions and sense of purpose derived from helping others. There is no indication of intense emotional pain or despair commonly associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post is generally upbeat and hopeful, with a focus on the positive impact of helping others."
"Consider this post: ""My Best Friend Feels More Like My Daughter I love my best friend like family and if anything were to happen to her, you can know I'd be there in an instant. But I feel awful admitting that I really don't like spending time with her anymore. We're both in our late twenties and I'm sort of the only family she has since she severed ties with her parents (a choice I completely agree was for the best). We've been best friends for the past decade and I've seen her through some really difficult times. She's faced a lot of struggles, mostly stemming from the terrible relationship she had with her family and the financial burden separating from them put on her life. Unfortunately, many of those struggles are ongoing and have really dominated our friendship. We spend more time talking about her problems than we do hanging out. I've gotten up at 3:00am to talk with her on the phone because she had a nightmare and she's scared. I've left my job early to go help her because she left hers early in tears. Days that are supposed to be fun (a movie, a game night, making dinner together) end up with me supporting her because she's upset about something, and suddenly the whole evening is gone. I don't want to exaggerate, but I'd say 70% of the times I see her I have to go into ""support mode."" And unfortunately, I've realized that I don't enjoy her as a friend and I honestly don't think I ever will again. The dynamic of our friendship has changed and it's never going to be what it was. Don't get me wrong, I care deeply for her and want to be there for her if she needs me, but the fact of that matter is I've found myself not reaching out to her anymore because it's just not a pleasant experience. When we do hang out, it's not because I want to; it's because I feel that's what she needs. She's a burden. She's a burden I bear willingly. But she's a burden. I don't know what to do. I really wish there were an easy way to say ""I don't like you anymore, so please don't be hurt that I don't reach out, but god you don't know how much I care about you."""" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does express some negative emotions and a sense of burden in the friendship, but it does not exhibit the profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression. The poster mentions feeling conflicted about their friendship and not enjoying spending time with their friend anymore, but still expresses a deep care and concern for their well-being. They also express a desire to be there for their friend if needed. This suggests that the negative emotions may stem more from the dynamics of the friendship rather than a pervasive sense of emotional distress associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Letter To Dad - Christian Fatherhood Author Kent Nerburn once wrote, “It is much easier to become a father than to be one.” This rings true, even for those men who really want to be a father. With enough hard work and determination we can master a career, a hobby, or a sport but it is difficult to even control anything in fatherhood, let alone master it. When the baby starts crying, how do we make her stop? When our son starts failing classes in school, how do you motivate him and help him with both the drive and the subject matter? Fatherhood is slow and daunting work.

Reasoning: The post discusses the challenges and difficulties of fatherhood, particularly in terms of how to handle situations such as a crying baby or a child struggling in school. However, there is no clear indication of emotional distress, hopelessness, or lack of enjoyment in the role of fatherhood. The tone of the post appears more reflective and informative rather than expressing profound emotional pain or symptoms commonly associated with depression."

They also mention engaging in self-destructive behaviors and harboring thoughts of wanting the world to be destroyed. The overall tone is one of deep emotional distress and a lack of hope for the future, aligning with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."

"Consider this post: ""Dropping by to mention you should take some Vitamin D supplements. Of course, check with your doctor. Etc. etc. Vitamin D is the sunshine pill that most people are deficient in. This is also much more of an issue in colder areas or for those who cover up from the sun often. The best way to get vitamin D is through certain food combinations and routines in sitting in delicate morning sunlight and in most cases, taking a supplement is necessary to keep this vitamin flowing in your body. Vitamin D is best absorbed with calcium, so if you’re taking a supplement, finding foods, or sitting in the sun consider to add the calcium as well. You will find that your mood will be better or more stable with vitamin D consumption. Make sure to strive for a more regulated sleeping schedule as well and something to keep your mind stimulated without an electronic screen.

Honestly, i often feel envy of his high scores, actually sometimes i even help him to do an assignment (like sending him a copy of my assignment) which annoyingly also makes him get a higher score than me.

I used to deal with loneliness through friends on PlayStation but even those relationships feel like they're getting distant. I recently started talking to my former best friend from PS4 whom I've known for about 7 years but ever since he started seeing someone it feels like he's gotten meaner to me and doesn't care to be there for me in the same way anymore. I'm not sure if I'm depressed but I've never felt more alone or lost or confused in my life. I've managed to convince myself that I have no redeeming qualities and that my friends are only pretending to like me because they feel bad or somehow feel obligated to maintain a facade of friendship.

Both of us were really nice with each other and we were pretty good friends at first, but my introverted mind did not help with that. After a while I started to have feelings for her and I started bringing up topics that did not concern her and was too awkward. I used to always text her almost every single day of every single hour to the point that she told my friend that I was annoying her (I knew that a couple of months later). I knew that something was up and that I made her upset but I never really knew what it was. I tried many different approaches to become her friend again but it all lead back to her thinking that I want to date her (she is not the type of person who would want to date at this age). After a year or so is when I figured out that I made her uncomfortable and gave her the notion that I wanted to talk to her only to date her and nothing else. I had an idea to confront her and apologize to her and tell her the truth of what I wanted from her but I keep having panic attacks and anxiety every time I think about doing it. What do you guys think I should do? Some might say that I should leave it behind, but I did such a horrible thing to such a great person and in all my life I have never met someone so true, genuine and wholesome in my life so I cannot give her up and make her feel this way about me.

I’m always holding onto the shred of hope that we will pick up where we left off, when I know this isn’t going to happen. I can’t let go of the relationships that didn’t work because I am unable to create new ones. I’m alone as I’ve ever been. I can’t even have guy friends because I’m bad with competition.

I guess I can be happy that I’ve started to make changes. They say change your habits and your mind will follow.

"Consider this post: ""Close friend becoming distant.... So I’ve (f,21) had a friend (m,21) that I’ve known for over two years, and we typically text or snap daily. There are times where we are texting or snapping straight for a couple of hours or we get busy with other stuff so we reply when we have a chance. Two weeks ago we had been hanging out at his place and everything to me seemed normal. Then out of the blue this week I feel as though he’s become extremely distant. He stopped basically replying to me at all. It’s been a couple of days in a row that he only responds a couple of times in the morning and then is gone during the entire day. Since I’ve known him, he has never been this way. (I'm sure some might say he's in a relationship, but he's currently single. Plus when he was in a relationship, he didn't act this way.) So last week I had sent him something early in the day and he didn’t reply until the following day. I didn’t think much of it because the next couple of days we were chatting like nothing and I was sure he was completely busy. Keep in mind, this was a couple days before he basically went blank on me. It actually got me thinking of what I had said that first day and think why he’d be so mad possibly to respond. The day that it had all started I had told him I had applied to a place and had gotten a interview the following day. I told him this even though he’s told me he’s been applying to different places and hasn’t gotten a single interview. When I told him I didn’t think that it would affect him that much since he’s told me he’d never apply to the place I’m gonna start working at. (Like he straight up told me he’d rather die than work at that place.) However, he's not the type to be petty or take things like that extremely hard and to heart. I’m not sure how I should think about all of this.I have anxiety (which is why I’m stressing) but I’m telling myself he may be going through something and I don’t want to just push him. We’ve gotten extremely close enough to the point where we’ve discussed things that are vulnerable things. He's dealt with major stuff and so have I, so I also find it weird that he wouldn’t talk to me about any of it (if it was something personal). Should I continue waiting basically a day for a response, or let it ride out and see if he gets back to himself and talks? Do you think he’s trying to ghost me? Or should I ask him what’s happening? (And if I do what should I say so that I’m not exactly targeting him). He has depression and we have discussed serious matters so I don't want to make him feel bad. Feel free to ask any questions. Thanks!"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression.

I feel trapped at an absolute dead end in my life, and I'm not even in my twenties yet. I might as well be, considering everything I have to do. I turned 17 a few months ago, and things have only gotten worse. My parents are completely delusional and can't grasp the fact that thet cause suffering for their own benefit. They would punch you in the face and find any excuse in the book to give a reason behind what they did, even if there wasn't one. My mom is an asshole, to put it nicely. She's very controlling. I've called and made my own therapy appointments only to find out she cancelled them, resulting in me having to find a different therapist AND doctor twice because they wouldn't take me because of canceling so many times, and I still haven't found either, so no therapy or medication. I have next to no friends because of how she is, coupled with my inability to speak without getting anxiety. My dad is a lazy dirtbag who fights with me constantly for no reason other than he hates me. He hates how liberal I am, he hates the people I like, whatever I like he probably hates. He sits in front of a TV all day watching shit, he bitches about anything he can, yet does absolutely nothing to fix the issue that he's the main cause of. No clean dishes?

More gets done quicker in less time when I get up than the whole time they've been up. I hate this stupid town and I hate my life. It feels like I'm destined for absolute failure. School puts a heavy amount of pressure on me too. I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up, that would be ideal honestly. The list of things that make me happy and want to live grows shorter every day, and I'm so, so lost on what to do anymore. I feel so uncomfortable and just... wrong.

Our friendship has been through SO MUCH during that time: the death of her father, relationships and breakups, we've worked several jobs together and lived together. We jokingly call each other ""husband and wife""! She's an artist by practice and (through her inheritance) has the ability to not have to work a full time job and simply practice art. She's getting recognized internationally and is also just started as the creative director at a local female owned bar/art house. I am SUPER excited to see her doing all these things and I ALWAYS go to the openings of her events and show support when I can. I have traveled with her to art shows and helped set up her booth. Recently, I've had several bad dreams about her. In one dream, I was choking her and screaming in her face. In my dream last night, I was stalking her, trying to find out if she was ""cheating on me"". I think what I'm most jealous of is her freedom while I'm chained to a desk job all day. How do I address this so that I don't end up being resentful for her success! I feel like I'm being left behind. TL;DR I'm jealous of my successful friend and want to stop."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster is experiencing feelings of jealousy towards their successful best friend. However, the tone of the post is not overwhelmingly negative or despairing.

"Consider this post: ""I made a word cloud of all my depressive posts over the past three years. https://i.imgur.com/hNbtyW4.png This is based on all the posts on my throwaway account (this is my main account and has too many unrelated posts to sort through) since 2014. I think it's noteworthy that some of the biggest words in the cloud are negative. While going back over these posts from so relatively long ago, I noticed that most of the older ones seemed like they were written by a total stranger. If it were somebody else saying those things about me, it would be called harassment, but it was me saying those things about myself. All in all, this has really made me realize that all the things I have written about myself are way off-base, and are only true in my mind during a depressive episode. I know something's wrong, but I don't know what to do about it. In some ways I'm sure I'll always think this way about myself, regardless of what I do, but I wish there were an easy way to manage it. I used [this](https://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/) word cloud generator. Cheers."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression.

Wherever I send my applications I get rejects. This was my only dream and meant everything in life. All my friends and moved on getting jobs. I have an excellent profile and some really good work to show for but the leadership is a little unpredictable, so companies don't what to hire people like me.. I watched so many people cheat their way through exams and projects and gone to get hired by companies like Amazon and Google. I have not seen my family in three years. And can barely afford to eat more than one meal a day. I'm getting recurring nightmares of being a failure and this makes me want to end it all. I've decided to stay in the US as long as I legally can. Then then, if I'm not getting a job.. I'm simply ending it. I have nothing else to live for.

"Consider this post: ""Classmate/ bullying problems I have a classmate who constantly bullies our other classmates. Seems like she feels as if she is superior, the leader of our whole class and everyone has to follow and do what she says. If someone is late to the meetings she is harassing them. She is being very rude and insulting. Her voice is always extremely loud, and if she has a problem with people she always shouts it to the class instead of approaching the person and discussing it with them like a normal person would do. For example, she was upset with a group of her classmates because they didnt want to follow whatever she says, and she heard that they might have said something bad about her, but instead of approaching them to ask them about it, if its true or whatsoever, everytime we have meetings she will just talk extra loud and will let our whole class listen to her nonsense comments like she keeps on talking about ""fake people"", as if she wanted the group who said something about her to hear it and feel guilty. I dont get why she does it and why she is the way she is. Does anyone have an idea? And what should we do about it? It's getting annoying and I know already if we would approach and talk to her she would put the blame on everyone else and just be more mad and find stupid excuses. Does anyone have any advice? By the way, including teachers or some other people doesnt help either so any other advices or info to shed light on this is welcome. Thank you"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression.

"Consider this post: ""I don't know what my problem is Hello, I've never posted here before. I'm a 28 year old guy and have a decent job that I like, it's quiet and involves a lot of puzzle solving and I'm pretty good at it. I've never had a ton of friends because I'm very particular and not very open with people so it takes a long time to build up relationships, but the friends I do have are outstanding and I wouldn't trade them for anything. I'm kind of the funny guy but my humor is very blue. I got bullied a lot in grade school and learned to make people laugh because it'd get them to not make fun of me. I think it just kind of stuck. I don't know if any of that information is really important, just wanted to give it in case that's something that people do here. For at least 5 years, I have a hard time doing anything outside of my job alone without crawling up inside my head. All the things that I used to do for enjoyment like listening to music or playing video games, I just can't do anything anymore. It's like a wave of apathy that very rarely lifts. Occasionally, I pick up a razor blade and will press it into my shoulder or hand and I don't really know why to be honest. I don't know if I like the pain or maybe I like having something else to focus on for a minute. Or just to feel something that isn't apathy for a moment. I think about dying sometimes. Why we're here, what's the point if it ends the same. I doubt I'd ever kill myself because there are things I care about here that I wouldn't leave behind like that, mainly my mom and brother. I worry my brother will end up like me. Is there anything I can do? I don't know what a pill could do for me or if a pill works. I think the brain is so complex that it couldn't, but I guess I don't know. I don't want to be in a mental fog or be unaware or not be me anymore. I've also always kind of thought that it's human nature to feel this way: that everybody gets down, gets bored, thinks about their mortality, etc. and that I'm just being soft and need to suck it up. Life is difficult, I just need to learn to deal with it maybe. I don't know what's going on but I don't like feeling like that. If I'm hanging out with friends or family I'm usually fine, it's being alone with myself and having time alone where I can't entertain myself and waste away. I can't really explain it. Does anyone else feel like this? What helps you? I've never talked to a therapist or anything like that and understand you cannot give a diagnosis on here, but if you know any methods to help me get out of that feeling, I'd be eternally grateful. Is this what depression feels like and I've just been in denial about having it for years?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes a lack of enjoyment or pleasure in activities they used to find enjoyable, such as listening to music or playing video games.

"Consider this post: ""Anhedonia.. anyone else experience it? I just want to vent and have some insight. I never ""fall"" in love anymore. I'm lucky if I can even feel love. My current boyfriend is so supportive, but as the past few years of my life, just can't fall in love. I don't feel the own love or care for my family or friends. I don't care if something happened to my friends, and I don't care if I never see my loving, caring parents again for a long time, or ever. I don't care to help friends or family with anything. I have no passions in life. I have no hobbies. I'm not passionate about my family, friends, work, school, boyfriend, hobbies, my Jeep, animals, etc.. NOTHING excites me, brings me happiness or joy or peace. OCD, anhedonia and depression control everything. The only moments of Bliss I get are sometimes with my boyfriend, I get giddy about thinking about our future, or seeing a selfie he sent me while at work and make me swell. Those are occasional, but the only thing I ever feel that's positive to a somewhat major degree. I think my new birth control (first time on it) has made my depression worse. I don't believe in antidepressants for myself. I've been stressed out so much I've lost a bunch of weight too. Now that I've vented, I just don't want to feel alone. I want this to go away. I want to be excited to see my boyfriend at the end of the day, and excited for the day I may marry him. I want to have a hobby I am passionate about.

Usually I'm pretty good at bouncing back but this job just broke something inside me. I'm a damn failure. Three attempts at college. Flunked out after the first year. That's ok, college isn't for everyone. Try a bunch of min wage jobs. Get fired or quit with in the first month or two. I can't do damn thing. I have no motivation to do anything at all anymore. I used to clock around 3-4 hours a day gaming because it was something I genuinely enjoyed. I've gotten 30 minutes in an entire damn week. I literally just can't muster the strength to want to do it. I've been pulling away from people because it's just exhausting to talk to them. I literally just get tired after five minutes of conversation. It's insane. We'll barely be through the how's your day been going before I already want to go somewhere else because it's so draining. I've hit a complete rock wall in therapy. I tell my therapist nearly all of this shit and she helps me as best she can but there's only so much she's able to do. She has no magic way of instilling me with motivation. Like... to put it into perspective. I stared at a wall for 2 hours today. Because I just was to tired to anything else. 2 hours! I wasn't thinking about anything. I wasn't being bored. I just don't have motivation to do anything! But what's worse is the moment I start thinking again is the moment all the sadness washes over me. It's like I'm in the middle of a vast, dark ocean and can't find shore. I swim and I swim and I swim but salvation is just nowhere to be seen. And I'm beginning to grow tired. I have no future ahead of me. Nothing to look forward too. I go through thousands of career tests and applications and all I see is that I'm either not interested enough or not good enough for any career. And I can't simply work for money. Money in and of itself just isn't good enough for me to work at a job I hate or am completely uninterested in. That's the strain of these minimum wage jobs, some of them I've had to quit because they've literally made me suicidal. I'm so lost right now. The world looks like a very dark place where I have to suffer in agony just to get by. I'm so tired of fighting. I'm so tired of trying. I'm just. So. Tired. It has been a very long time since I've been this low. I feel like I'm doomed. Like this is all the happiness I'll ever be afforded. That even if I get the job of my dreams and all the money I could possibly want, I will always have a big, dark cloud hanging over my head.

"Consider this post: ""My mom wants to see me... naked? Whew, so my parents moved to America from Korea and had my sister and I. They still stick to their homeland culture and tradition, but I've become accustomed to how things are done in America. Where kids have privacy and all. My mom has been pestering me to see me naked. She says it's to size me to buy bras, but I don't think so. She invades my personal privacy a lot, like butt slapping and I sometimes catch her staring at my privates. She comments on if I'm wearing a bra or not and I find it kind of creepy. I get that it may be normal in Korean culture, but I've asked her to stop since I feel uncomfortable. She said no, simply because she gave birth to me. Whenever I'm changing, she barges into my room barely even a second after knocking and stares at me when I'm semi naked. I asked her for some privacy, after all, I'm almost 13, but she rejects it. My mom made plans to go to a public bathhouse, but I told her I don't want to. She wants to drag me out and ""rub all the dead skin cells off my back"" but I feel like she only wants to see me naked. She recently got breast implants and keeps bragging about how she increased in size, and how she's regaining her youth. I'm happy that she is, but now I feel like she's shaming me for being flat. Hello? I'm 12. She tells me about how much bigger she was in comparison to other girls back then, then shows my sister her cleavage. I asked my mom if breasts define a woman, you know how she replied? Yes. If you want to fit in, yes. If you want to be able to wear todays modern clothes, yes. If you want to attract men, yes. I honestly LIKE being flat, but my mom says I'll change my mind. I respect the fact that I may, but I'm still sort of annoyed. I think she just wants to see me naked. Not as a parent, but as an inspector. I don't know if it's exactly normal in Asian culture, but I feel extremely uncomfortable. Any advice? Sorry if I sounded sorta whiney. (Also, she sneaks into my room at night when she thinks I'm sleeping without a bra)"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits emotional distress and discomfort, but it does not necessarily indicate symptoms of depression. The main focus of the post is on the uncomfortable and inappropriate behavior of the poster's mother, rather than the individual's own emotional state. While the situation described is concerning and may have an impact on the poster's well-being, it does not provide enough information to conclude that the poster is suffering from depression. The tone of the post seems more frustrated and seeking advice rather than indicative of severe depressive symptoms."
"Consider this post: ""A rant, I guess I had to come off of my antidepressants for medical testing. I'm finally off of them and I can't take this. I didn't think they were working and I definitely wasn't where I wanted to be when I was at my maximum dose, but oh my God. I started them for anxiety mostly so I'm surprised that I'm relapsing so hard into depression. I just wish I didn't exist-- eh, better yet I wish I didn't have to participate in every day life. I don't know what to do. I used to have so much motivation to finish my college work and now I have none. I have finals that start tomorrow that I haven't studied for at all. Like, not even a little. And somehow I don't care. That's just not like me. I'm exhausted from putting so much effort in all the time. I exhausted from being stressed all the time. I don't want to keep doing this. I just want to sleep. And to think I have four more years ahead of me. I don't know what I'm going to do. I already feel like a failure. I keep thinking that maybe I could find something to take my mind off things but I have no hobbies. I don't enjoy anything any more. Not even eating, which I used to love probably too much but hey. I want to lie in my floor and watch the days pass by me. I don't want to have to keep trying. Another thing is everything and everyone irritates the living hell out of me now. The smallest thing sends me over the edge into my spiral. Three weeks ago if I spilled my coffee I would have laughed it off. It happened the other day and I cried for hours and was so angry. Three weeks ago I was better than this. And I'm crashing all of a sudden. I don't know how I'm going to study for my finals and maintain my GPA to keep my scholarships. I'm fucked probably. My therapist is not that great and I haven't seen her in awhile and I don't have money to go back to her. My psych appointment isn't until late January, after my medical procedure. I just want to be happy and have some motivation for fucks sake."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post includes strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes the distressing experience of coming off their antidepressants for medical testing and expresses a sense of hopelessness and despair. They mention relapsing into depression and feeling a lack of motivation, exhaustion, and lack of enjoyment in activities. The mention of not caring about important tasks such as studying for finals, feeling like a failure, and thoughts of wanting to sleep and avoid daily life all align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression. The mention of experiencing heightened irritability and intense emotional reactions to small incidents also suggests a significant level of emotional distress. Overall, the post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain and despair that indicates a severe depressive state."
"Consider this post: ""Is she toxic or am I reading too much into it...rant warning So to nutshell my relationship with her is that we met at our last job and hang out a lot. It's still a fairly new friendship but I'm noticing some things that are starting to get to me. I'm unemployed now and she has a awesome new job. So first thing I noticed was she didn't used to be the one to call me but then when she needs a ride somewhere then she wants to chat and will try to segway the ride request in. If she made a habit out of calling any other time then I wouldn't stress it. It just makes me feel used when ""I just want to check on you"" turns to ""I need a ride"". Which brings me to the other issue. When she does call me it's the most disrespectful phone etiquette I have ever seen. After she knows she is going to get a ride she stays on the call(must be out of guilt or not wanting to make it seem like it's the only thing she wants.) but while she's on the phone she does not pay attention to me. Like she'll make active listening sounds that don't match up, like uh huh and a giggle when I just told her that I might need to give my cats up. Without telling me or warning or any sort of hint she'll just start talking to someone else around her like I'm not even on the other end. Worst yet almost always these calls are while she is at work and is just bored. On my end I'm distraction free and at the most filling out a job applications or pacing and I dunno I feel like if you are going to call your friend you should acknowledge they are on the other line and not just background noise while you browse the internet. Which brings me to her job. Her job to me is the most ideal job I could think of and I already know that but she brags about to the point that I'm getting really bitter. She keeps telling me about how many hours she's getting and during one of those phone calls even worked out how much she was expecting to make on her next check(unprompted). And she's so excited about 3 week paid vacation she is getting, and her health benefits and tuition reimbursement so she's going to take some classes on company dime. I mean I expressed how happy I was for her but she brings it up enough that I just wonder if she likes hurting me. Then there is her and her boyfriend. There is a whole thing about her and her psycho ex who even though made her feel afraid for her life, she still loves and talks to. WHILE WITH HER BOYFRIEND. I don't think she cheats on her boyfriend but I don't understand that whole deal that seems like an issue for another reddit thread all together. But yeh she does brag about how much sex she has with her boyfriend and how much they love each other. Which brings me to this next issue that I couldn't even wrap my head around. So I brought her home from work the other night and we were hanging out at my apartment. At some point she realizes that she forgot her keys back at work. This was after her work closed for the day. So I don't see the big deal I offer up ""well when your boyfriend picks you up then he can let you in."" But she doesn't seem to be hooking to that and is like ""I'm going to check the bus scheduled and just because I'm curious I'll check uber prices."" I'm really confused at this point. Essentially, her plan was to just go to her boyfriends work and hang out there till he finishes closing. Keep in mind we are neighbors, he doesn't have to go out of his way more than one street over and he has picked her up from my place before. Now he works about 30mins away so it would be a hell of a trek to drop her off there and make way back while it's dark and rainy and I don't know the area at all. At some point the brother of her boyfriend calls and says they can go hangout while she's locked out and she doesn't even ask me if I want to join or anything just leaves as if she had just been waiting at the busstop that whole time. She reassures me that she does like hanging out and I think we do have fun when she is hanging out. So I really don't want to cut her out of my life as I tend to"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays several indicators of emotional distress and possible depression. The poster expresses feelings of being used, disrespected, and bitter towards their friend. They also mention feeling like a victim and questioning the worthiness of the friendship. These emotions, combined with the mention of feeling depressed and not knowing why, suggest a significant level of emotional distress and a potential correlation with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Life for me is gonna fall apart and it'll be the end of me (this is my first post and I'm on mobile so sorry if the formatting is off) So recently my parents have been on me (M 17) about getting a job, getting college information, SAT information, getting my licence and spending more time with the family. Tonight they both came at me and yelled about how I wasn't going to amount to anything and that I pretty much am ruining their current lives. They threw so much at me that it broke me and I broke down in the bathroom. My only remedy for all this pain is my girlfriend. She's there for me no matter what and understands what I go through. Recently I've been slipping a little in my grades (All B's and C's) and my parents have a very strict rule that if I don't keep good grades I'll have to leave my girlfriend. My problem is that if I leave her I'll have nothing to help me get through hard times. I'm only living for her and I'll have no point to be around otherwise. Sorry for venting but I've been wanting to post here for months but never felt as if my problems have been worth it."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits several indicators of depression. The poster describes feeling overwhelmed and broken by the pressure and expectations placed on them by their parents. This is evident through the mention of being yelled at and feeling like they are ruining their parents' lives. The post also reveals a lack of hope for the future, as the poster believes their life will fall apart and that they have no point to be around if they leave their girlfriend. The mention of using their girlfriend as a remedy for pain suggests a reliance on external sources of support and a lack of internal coping mechanisms. The overall tone of despair, hopelessness, and worthlessness aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Will I ever feel beautiful I lost alot of weight, went from a size 20 to a size 10/12 uk size and I get told I look good. Guys who approach me forget me when they see how broken I am inside. ""No one will love you if you are unattractive..."" my family looks like the cover of a magazine and I look like shit. I hate myself, I just broke a mirror and my hands are bleeding. Please when will these emotions pass? Should i save up for sugery? Will i feel beautiful then? Why does my sister look like a model, my bro too 6""4 and attractive. Guys used me to get to my sister and girls used me to get to my brother. Someone please. Like me for me and tell me looks don't matter. Please get to know me. Please. Please."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep dissatisfaction with the poster's appearance and self-worth. They mention losing a significant amount of weight, which is often seen as an achievement, but they still do not feel attractive or desirable. The mention of being forgotten by guys and feeling used by others because of the attractiveness of their siblings suggests a sense of unworthiness and a belief that their appearance determines their value. The plea for someone to like them for who they are and to tell them looks don't matter indicates a desperate need for validation and acceptance. The self-harm mentioned at the end of the post further highlights the severity of their emotional distress. Overall, the post conveys a deep sense of self-loathing and a preoccupation with physical appearance, which are common markers of depression."
"Consider this post: ""I know I'm overreacting but I need to vent So there is this girl I've been friends with for three years. Right now she is almost done with college but I still have to take some courses so we don't see each other that often. That's why she told me two weeks ago we should meet up. I told her to pick out the day which suit her best. She said Monday and I agreed. Turns out my mum needed money so I have almost nothing on me and because of that I told her I could hang out but couldn't go to the restaurant she said we should try. She replied that she ""couldn't make it tomorrow"" (today) and I thought wth?! you said Monday? It was you the one who said Monday not me... Anyway she said let's meet up on Wednesday and I said ok but tbh I don't feel like going out whatsoever. She was sorry because, and I quote, ""I thought we were going to meet today"" and I'm like dafuq. She, all of a sudden, forgot about it?! Does it make any sense? I guess she made plans with other people or whatever but fuck it, don't say one thing and then act like you didn't even say anything. I know I'm overreacting here but I'm so fucking tired of people and their ""you're my best friend"" and ""I love you, I care about you"" shit. The thing is I guess I'm pretty pissed off because I've always struggled to make friends but even when I have they don't give a shit. I'm so tired. Honestly, fuck everyone."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post displays strong emotions of frustration, anger, and disappointment, but it does not exhibit the core symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression. The individual expresses feeling overreactive and vents about a specific incident with a friend, highlighting their struggle to make and maintain friendships. While the post conveys some level of exhaustion and disillusionment with people, it does not demonstrate a deep sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, or despair that is typically indicative of very severe depression. The tone of the post suggests more annoyance and frustration rather than overwhelming emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""Don't want to live, don't want to die. I just want to stop existing. Vanish into thin air without a trace and wipe my entire existence off the face of the planet. I don't want anyone to love me or miss or care about me. I don't remember the last time I was actually happy and I don't see things ever getting better because they've been bad for so long. Nothing ever changes no matter how hard I try. I can't stand being alone, but when I'm around anyone I just want to isolate. I can't eat because I get sick after 2 bites. I can't sleep because I have nightmares or always dream about undesirable things. I just don't know anymore. This isn't living, but whatever it is, I don't want to do it."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a profound sense of despair, hopelessness, and desire for non-existence, which are strong indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses a lack of enjoyment or fulfillment from life, a feeling of being stuck in a perpetual state of suffering. They also mention attempts to change their situation without success, suggesting a prolonged struggle with their emotional state. The post also highlights difficulties with eating and sleeping, as well as a desire for both isolation and companionship, which are characteristic symptoms of depression.

"Consider this post: ""I want to share my experience moving to NYC from Israel - four months ago Hello everyone, I just thought it would do good for me to share my experience moving to this city among other new yorkers and maybe hearing some new voices of people who are living here and know better than me or even went through the same thing. So basically, I'm 28 years old and moved to NYC four months ago with my wife. My wife is doing her Ph.D. at Columbia University, and I just joined her (with a work permit during our stay here), and we are going to be here for at least 3.5 years, but we could choose to stay for five years if we wish to. (At the moment I don't see it happening) I have to say that moving here has been the most difficult challenge I've ever been through in my life. First, though my English is not bad at all, I'm SO, SO insecure about it. I'm feeling afraid to open my mouth and say complicated things, and it is depressing me. (I am a person who's talking a lot by nature. I've always been like that) And I feel like someone took away that ability from me and I'm much less charismatic in English than in Hebrew which affects my confidence tremendously... After smoking weed for 4-5 years almost every day in Israel, I quit doing it since the first month I got here only because it made me feel very anxious (it used to make me feel quite the opposite before) I used to be a teacher in Israel and pretty quickly I've found a job as a teacher that teaches Hebrew here in New York. (In Israel I used to teach History which I found much more interesting than teaching a language, but that's what I got here, so I have to live with that) A few days ago, I had a conversation with my boss, and apparently, they are pleased by my work there, and they asked me if I am willing to continue for next year which is nice to hear even though I don't like this job that much. I guess I will have to compromise. My wife and I are supported by an excellent scholarship, and we don't have to worry a lot about money or health insurance so, on the financial field, we are kinda covered. But being here makes me feel powerless. Obviously, I don't have my good friends here with me, and I feel much less ""special"" as a person. I feel like I am only one among millions who are trying to survive in this big hectic city. In the beginning, I thought it is beautiful that this city is full of people from all around the world, but now it just feels to me that everyone are strangers to each other and it seems like it is the loneliest city in the world at the moment. And because I don't have friends here and I am married (so meeting with girls on tinder etc. is not an option) I don't have many reasons to leave the house and it is kinda sad. The only reasons I'm leaving my house is for yoga classes, work, and restaurants with my wife. Other than that I don't have any other reasons to leave the house... The weather is fucking horrible, and it is so cold it is painful to me being outside. Anyways, I don't expect from you guys to be my therapist or giving me some life-changing advices... I guess I post this to release some steam. So if you managed to read my post until the end, Thank you :) And I hope things will improve for me. I've always lived in Israel and only left for trips. The longest was 3-4 months, and I have never relocated my life to anywhere else. So maybe it is just a matter of time until I will start to feel more like home here. If you have anything to share from your experience, that would be lovely just to know that I am not the only one who is going through this adjustment period. Thanks again for reading and for your patience. Have a great week everyone"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of depression. The poster describes feeling insecure and fearful in their ability to communicate in English, which has affected their confidence and charisma. They also mention feeling depressed and powerless, describing themselves as just one among millions trying to survive in a lonely city. The poster expresses a lack of social connections and reasons to leave the house, except for specific obligations like work and yoga classes. They also mention feeling sad and experiencing physical pain from the cold weather. These feelings of isolation, low self-esteem, lack of motivation, and physical discomfort align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""I just ate cereal out of a pot because I was too lazy to wash a single bowl. I honestly have no idea how a day is gonna go anymore."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of apathy and lack of motivation towards even basic tasks like washing a dish. The poster describes feeling uncertain and unaware of how their day will unfold, which suggests a lack of structure and direction in their life. This lack of motivation and disinterest in self-care aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression, particularly a symptom called anhedonia, which is a difficulty finding pleasure in activities that were once enjoyable. Overall, the post indicates a level of emotional distress and indifference towards daily life that is consistent with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Anyone depressed in spite of good life circumstances? A lot of people here are depressed for very good reasons. I really don't have any. I'm pretty happy with my life set up (of course there are some things I'd change but on the whole it's good). I just have this endogenous, chemical depression that's as bad as being in physical pain. I've been on so many meds in the past and they don't seem to work for me anymore. I run distance every single day and eat well. Not asking for advice as such, just interested to hear if any of you guys are depressed even though your lives are good on paper."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster is experiencing depression despite having good life circumstances. They mention that they are happy with their life overall, but still experience a deep sense of depression that feels as bad as physical pain. They mention trying various medications and exercising regularly, but these methods haven't been effective in alleviating their depression. The post reflects a sense of hopelessness and resignation, as well as a desire to connect with others who may be experiencing a similar situation. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""I'm not dead. I'm trying my best now to get a full recovery First off sorry to anyone in this sub who messaged me or was worried about what I posted before. I haven't even come on here besides to see the front page. I didn't hang myself although I was really close too. It would've been my third attempt and even though shit sucks right now I'm trying my best not to. Thank you for whoever attempted to talk me out of it, I read them all. Here's to all of us getting better and living our lives to the fullest"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post begins by acknowledging previous concerning behavior and apologizing for any worry caused. The poster mentions feeling close to hanging themselves and indicates that this would have been their third attempt. This demonstrates a significant level of emotional distress and potential suicidal ideation, which are clear indicators of severe depression. However, the post transitions to a more positive tone, expressing a commitment to getting better and living life to the fullest. This could indicate a mixture of emotions but still aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
