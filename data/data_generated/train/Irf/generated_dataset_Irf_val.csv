While the individual expresses intense negative emotions, these are directed inward (self-hatred) and outward (anger towards another person), rather than reflecting a lack of belongingness or connectedness with others. 3. There is no evidence in the post to suggest that the individual feels disconnected from their social network or lacks meaningful relationships, which are key components of thwarted belongingness."
"Consider this post: ""I hate myself so much It hurts I hate my body Life is suffering I feel deprresed and angry And there is person i hate so much i fucking hate him omgg"" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post expresses intense self-hatred and a belief that life is suffering, which can indicate a negative self-perception and a lack of self-worth, both of which are risk factors for perceived burdensomeness. 2. The individual's anger and depression may contribute to feelings of being a burden to others, as they might believe their negative emotions affect those around them. 3. The desire to escape suffering and the intense self-directed negativity suggest a potential wish to relieve others of the perceived burden of their presence."

The individual expresses frustration over unmet personal goals, which may contribute to feelings of inadequacy in social contexts. 3. The exhaustion described ('So fucking tiring') suggests a potential lack of energy to engage socially, further indicating thwarted belongingness."
"Consider this post: ""One year ago today, i promised myself that i will change, but i didn't change shit. feeling all broken and hopeless inside. i'm still that person. I didn't change at all. I thought i could. I thought I tried. What will the next year be, another 365 days of trying to get by with the world. So fucking tiring. I'm getting nowhere"" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post reflects deep self-disappointment and hopelessness, which can translate into feeling like a burden to others. 2. The individual's focus on their perceived failure ('I didn't change at all') may lead to thoughts of being inadequate or burdensome in relationships. 3. The exhaustion and lack of progress described could contribute to a belief that others would be better off without them."

I don‚Äôt even know if there‚Äôs a light at the end of the tunnel"" Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post expresses hopelessness and doubt about future happiness, which can lead to social withdrawal. 2. The fear of relapse suggests a lack of trust in oneself, potentially extending to difficulties in maintaining social connections. 3. The uncertainty about 'a light at the end of the tunnel' indicates a broader sense of disconnection and lack of belonging."

"Consider this post: ""Suicide is the best option, right?"" Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?","No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post does not mention any interpersonal relationships or feelings of loneliness or alienation. 2. The focus is solely on the idea of suicide as an option, without any reference to social connections or belongingness. Therefore, there is no evidence of thwarted belongingness in this post."
"Consider this post: ""Suicide is the best option, right?"" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post directly mentions suicide as the 'best option,' which can imply a belief that the individual's existence is a burden to others. 2. The lack of context about relationships does not negate the inherent suggestion of perceived burdensomeness when suicide is presented as a solution."

Reasoning: The post describes a stressful situation related to moving and procrastination, but it does not mention feelings of loneliness, isolation, or a lack of connectedness. The individual mentions not wanting to bother their parents, but this is framed as a desire to avoid burdening them rather than a feeling of being disconnected or unwanted.

The individual expresses a sense of resignation and boredom, indicating a lack of purpose or fulfillment, which can contribute to feelings of thwarted belongingness. 2. The mention of a planned suicide attempt and the statement 'I just wanna end it' suggest a desire to escape, which can be linked to feelings of isolation and disconnection. 3.

"Consider this post: ""I... I can't imagine dying, it's not something that I want. And yet these thoughts they still exist and seem to scare and creep and haunt. Plenty of ways to go about it, some are easy, some are not. I let the feelings fill me up till I become too deep in thought. I'm standing on a bridge, I'm looking down at frigid water. I have come here with a thought, and intentions of self-slaughter. But when I stand up on the railing, I want someone to come, Someone to shout and pull me down, stop me from doing something dumb. I want a stranger's embrace, to reassure me it's okay. To tell me that it isn't worth it, that the trip's only one-way I want to bawl and breakdown, in the arms of the unknown. So I can maybe feel cared about, and not feel so alone... Now I'm in my room, with a note and rope in hand. Thinking I'll finally fall through, let my thoughts and mind disband. But when I step off of that stool, I want my mom to come rush down, To pull me out my quiet guillotine, and stop my silent drown. Oh, she'd probably hug and sob, knowing what I had tried to do. Glad she ran down stairs to check on me, as if had been on cue. That night would stay with her forever, make her always high alert, To stop her child from disappearing, or end up permanently hurt. However in both situations, I would simply end up dead. That is, if I could follow through with all these thoughts that haunt my head. Alas I am not suicidal, just a faking wannabee, Cause I don't actually want to die, I just want someone to save me...""

Reasoning: 1. The post expresses a deep sense of hopelessness and fatigue, with the individual questioning the point of living and feeling unable to perform daily tasks. These feelings can contribute to perceived burdensomeness. 2. The lack of emotional engagement (e.g., 'I feel nothing') and the inability to see a future for themselves may lead to the belief that they are a burden to others. 3. The post does not explicitly mention burdensomeness, but the overall tone of despair and disconnection suggests a risk of this interpersonal factor."

"Consider this post: ""I've had suicidal thoughts from a very young age and have never felt able to tell anybody about them because, realistically, there's no reason I should be depressed. So many people have it so much worse than I do and it makes me feel like my emotions are invalid, and that if I were to actually acknowledge them to someone else it would seem like I'm being dramatic and attention-seeking. At this point I wish I could just give my life to someone else who actually has it bad because it feels like I'm wasting it.""

"Consider this post: ""This is on wikipedia, the page title is ""Social psychology"". &gt; The self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people.[18]:109 Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by believing in a just world, blaming victims for their suffering, and making defensive attributions, which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality.[18]:111 Researchers have found that mildly depressed individuals often lack this bias and actually have more realistic perceptions of reality (as measured by the opinions of others).[20] Lol, sorry, i should have explained what this shit means. Realistic perception means you can understand both personal deffects and also situation ones, it just means you don't excuse yourself for your mistakes or wrong doings, but you also will not excuse anyone.

This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people.[18]:109 Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by believing in a just world, blaming victims for their suffering, and making defensive attributions, which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality.[18]:111 Researchers have found that mildly depressed individuals often lack this bias and actually have more realistic perceptions of reality (as measured by the opinions of others).[20] Lol, sorry, i should have explained what this shit means. Realistic perception means you can understand both personal deffects and also situation ones, it just means you don't excuse yourself for your mistakes or wrong doings, but you also will not excuse anyone. You have higher moral standards. You see things for what they are. Happy people will fuck up today, rationalize their bullshit away in one sentence and completely forget about it. They say it's strenght but in reality is just ignoring."" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. While the post primarily discusses psychological concepts, the final lines ('Happy people will fuck up today... in reality is just ignoring') imply a cynical view of others' behavior, which could reflect a belief that others are dismissive or burdensome in their interactions. 2. The emphasis on 'higher moral standards' and not excising anyone's mistakes might suggest a rigid perspective that could contribute to feelings of being misunderstood or burdensome in social contexts. 3. The tone of frustration ('rationalize their bullshit away') hints at potential interpersonal strain, aligning with perceived burdensomeness."

I know this is just a rough patch and that things will get better but right now it's hard for me to see that and I just needed to unload thus jumbled mess of thoughts off my chest. I have a better life than a lot of people and I'm gonna be fine it's just these down moments seem endless and it makes me feel stuck.""

While the post expresses emotional distress and a sense of being ignored, it does not explicitly mention feeling like a burden to others or thoughts of being better off gone. 2.

"Consider this post: ""so i‚Äôve had a few run ins with counselors in the past having to call my parents because i‚Äôm depressed and every time my parents have yelled at me saying i‚Äôm just looking for attention and i‚Äôve told them myself before that i have a few things wrong with me but they never believe me or tell me to get over it. my grades are basically all Fs and i‚Äôve been doing horribly lately so i talked to one of my teacher but he had to email my counselor and now she has to call them. i‚Äôve given them a fake email before (my moms old one that she lost the password to) so i was thinking of telling them she got a new phone and giving them my friends phone number instead. if i do, will i get in trouble or will my parents find out? i really want to avoid them knowing anything."" Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?","No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1.

"Consider this post: ""I don‚Äôt like to complain and so I don‚Äôt talk about my depression a lot to my friends/loved ones, I don‚Äôt want to worry them or be annoying.

The request for help ('Can you help me?') could imply a fear of being a burden, as they may feel their needs are too much for others to handle."
"Consider this post: ""So my depression is *very* treatment-resistant. I've lost track of how many different meds and med combos I've tried. Recently it was suggested that I try TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), which has been proven to be effective for depression like mine. My psychiatrist referred me to the doctor who does it, but I've been putting off actually making the appointment because I'm scared. You know how sometimes people don't like taking meds because they make them feel like they're not themselves anymore; like they make them feel numb or empty? It's sort of like that, except in reverse. I've had my depression for well over a decade, more than half my life, and I literally can't imagine what it'd be like if it actually got better. Would I still feel like me? I know that things would improve, obviously, but change is scary, and in a bizarre way, my depression is comfortable. It's been a constant for most of my life and I don't know who I'd be without it. TL;DR- I'm scared to try something that could work because I don't know who I'd be without my depression."" Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?","No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post focuses on the individual's personal struggle with treatment-resistant depression and fear of change, but it does not mention feelings of loneliness, isolation, or lack of connectedness. 2. The concerns are centered around identity and the fear of losing familiarity with their depression, not about social disconnection or belongingness."

Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post expresses fear and uncertainty about trying a new treatment (TMS) due to the long-standing presence of depression in their life. This suggests a deep identification with their depression, which can contribute to feelings of being a burden if they perceive their condition as unchangeable or a defining part of their identity. 2. The individual mentions that their depression is 'comfortable' and a 'constant,' indicating a reluctance to change, which can stem from a fear of losing a familiar state of being, even if it is negative. This reluctance can be linked to perceived burdensomeness if they feel their depression is a burden they must carry alone. 3. The post does not explicitly mention feeling like a burden to others, but the underlying fear of change and the unknown can indirectly reflect a sense of being stuck in a burdensome state."
"Consider this post: ""This is more of a rant I suppose. I find myself too many times crying, sulking over my life and my problems. I was homless in september. I scrape every day to eat but when I sit down, I realize there's fucking children without water. So many people died in 2017, bombings, mass shootings. Trump is our god damn president. I just dig myself deeper in this pit of depression and realization that, things may get better for me but I dont know about the rest of the world. Do I try to help? Do I just let it happen like everyone around me does? Does anyone else feel so hopeless to this degree?"" Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post describes feelings of hopelessness and despair about both personal and global issues, which can lead to a sense of isolation and disconnection from others. 2. The individual questions whether they should try to help or 'let it happen like everyone around me does,' suggesting a perception that others are indifferent or disconnected from the problems they care about. This can contribute to a sense of thwarted belongingness. 3. The post ends with a question asking if others feel similarly hopeless, indicating a desire for connection and understanding from others who might share their feelings, which underscores the lack of belongingness they currently experience."

It hurts and it ruins your head it's either suicide or find salvation in that person. I've never hurt this much over fucking fiction. This person as I know it is in my head. I am in love with a person I created, I don't even know this person, just her exterior, yet I feel like I'm close to this person and it hurts not imagining a fake relationship. It hurts so fucking bad it feels good to think abandoning this world. No regrets. Why? I am doing a favor to my crush and myself. Yet it still hurts I can't fall asleep. How does this make any sense? How strong is fictional love? Who is making me feel like this? I want to escape this hell. I already have crippling thoughts about my future and this just keeps coming up to me and it's so bad.
