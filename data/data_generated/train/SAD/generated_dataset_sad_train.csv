Reasoning: The worry about an aging pet ('our old cat, pebbles') and the consideration of euthanasia ('if we need to put her down') reflect concerns about the pet's health and the emotional burden of making such a decision. Thus, 'Health issues' (for the pet) and 'Emotional turmoil' (for the individual) are applicable."

Question: What is the stress cause of this post?","This post shows the stress cause related to everyday decision making.

The post does not provide enough context to definitively assign a specific stress cause, so the label 'Unknown' is fitting."
"Consider this post: ""My restaurant is closed due to COVID so no work/money for me."" Question: What is the stress cause of this post?","This post shows the stress cause related to financial problem. Reasoning: The post explicitly states that the restaurant is closed due to COVID, leading to no work or income.

Question: What is the stress cause of this post?","This post shows the stress cause related to social relationships. Reasoning: The post is vague and contradictory, with the poster stating they aren't complaining or judging but expressing frustration ('but man!').

"Consider this post: ""keeping an eye on the tenants"" Question: What is the stress cause of this post?","This post shows other stress causes.
