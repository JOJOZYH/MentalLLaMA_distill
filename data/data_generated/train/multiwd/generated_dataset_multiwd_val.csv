Towards the end of the first month, I ended up having surgery on my back.

"Consider this post: ""2017 was rough. My brain fell into cycles of self degradation way too easily, this led me down a spiral this year which made me end a long relationship, lose some friends, and made me put duties that would have helped me to the wayside like taking my dog out. The past few months leading to now has been anti social to say the least. I stopped trying to make plans with friends as I was tired of hearing no, my friends clearly didn't want me around a whole lot (since September I had a total of 2 outings with friends, pre September we spent probably too much time together at ~6 days a week). On top of that another good friend of mine moved away indefinitely. 2017 I realized I can't rely on my friends the way I thought I could, I wish I could but life doesn't work like that. My New Years resolution this year is to not base my happiness and social success around if my friends and I are having fun.

Any advice from those who have/had depression would be greatly appreciated. Well, just ranting for online does relief everything in which I had bottled up. So on new year, I just broke up with my girlfriend(4months) and connections from my close friends.

She was initially really supportive and that was why I was attracted to her, she helped me to elavate my abuse of tobacco but I feel as though I'll fall back into that sinkhole. People change and I don't blame her. She feels exhausted and does not feel the same way anymore. Right now I'm just really exhausted of everything. I have scheduled appointments for a psychiatrist that was done by the SAF, Singapore's Army basically. I don't know what to expect besides perhaps being announced as clinically depressed.

While doing that she would sing along to a song, calling me a coward and a weakling. She also saw me develop my eating disorder but never said anything untill it was too late. I've lost a lot of weight since then and come a long way but she never fails to rub it in my face. Even if I eat an apple as a snack, she would tell me to ""Watch the line"". These are just mere fragments of how she is towards me. Recently, I was talking to her about life partners. She flat out told me that, if anyone were to love me, they'd have to choose it very profoundly because I make everyone have a hard time. Now, don't get me wrong, I did have a rebellious teen period. I just don't know why she can't get a new image of me? Does anyone have tips on how to survive this passive agressive fiesta my mother has? Maybe things I can do to show her how I've changed? Would it be an idea for me to get some counseling? Pls help me..."" Question: Does the spiritual wellness dimension exist in the post?","No, this wellness dimension does not exist in the post.

"Consider this post: ""Hello everyone, I've been struggeling with this issue for a long time now. As long as I can remember, my mom had an odd way of expressing her love and nurturing my growth. I remember when I was 13 she would make me scrub the floors on my bare knees because I didn't help around enough in the house. While doing that she would sing along to a song, calling me a coward and a weakling. She also saw me develop my eating disorder but never said anything untill it was too late. I've lost a lot of weight since then and come a long way but she never fails to rub it in my face. Even if I eat an apple as a snack, she would tell me to ""Watch the line"". These are just mere fragments of how she is towards me. Recently, I was talking to her about life partners. She flat out told me that, if anyone were to love me, they'd have to choose it very profoundly because I make everyone have a hard time. Now, don't get me wrong, I did have a rebellious teen period. I just don't know why she can't get a new image of me? Does anyone have tips on how to survive this passive agressive fiesta my mother has? Maybe things I can do to show her how I've changed? Would it be an idea for me to get some counseling? Pls help me..."" Question: Does the physical wellness dimension exist in the post?","Yes, this wellness dimension exists in the post.

I do not have the skills one needs to make it in the real world. I feel so lethargic and weak. I struggle my way through sports practice everyday. I do not know how much longer I can keep going.

"Consider this post: ""Got married at 25 to my ex (then 23) after four years of dating back in 2014. She called it quits by March 2015 after less than a year of marriage.

She finally got around to having us exchange divorce paperwork a few months back, and on Jan 12 we'll be having a quick trial for a no-fault divorce. This was never a separation I wanted. I went from marriage counseling directly to weekly individual therapy last year, though I had found it unhelpful and stopped going after a few months.

I was invited to a few parties, but it‚Äôs wishful thinking to imagine myself having gone to any of them. So here I am, in this shithole apartment, with my mother sleeping in the bed next to mine so I can‚Äôt even get up to have a smoke without waking her. I‚Äôm only 17, I should be out having fun, meeting people, experiencing my youth, but my depression and anxiety are so bad I could hardly muster up the courage to even set foot outside. I can‚Äôt believe this is how I ended up. I know I know, I‚Äôm still young, I haven‚Äôt quite ‚Äúended up‚Äù anywhere yet, but I‚Äôve more or less made up my mind that suicide is the end goal. And with how bad my depression is getting, it‚Äôs gonna happen sooner rather than later. Anyway, Happy New Year.
