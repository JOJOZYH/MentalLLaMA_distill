"Consider this post: ""My ex used to shoot back with ""Do you want me to go with you?"" all the time, no matter what it was. I almost wonder if I blocked out him asking me that about our own wedding. I unloaded a terrible memory of this on my current BF today and he took it like a champ, I just could not stop chasing myself in circles over this and knew if I heard any sort of similar phrase I would lose it. I just needed to throw this out in the open, where others who might understand could 'hear' it."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. The post reveals emotional turmoil related to a past relationship, with the poster describing how they 'could not stop chasing myself in circles over this.'

"Consider this post: ""I haven’t said anything to him yet because I’m not sure how someone would take hearing that their partner has such fluctuations of feelings towards them (especially since he told me he loves me and is somewhat clingy). Nonetheless, I know a conversation will need to be had but I want to get my feelings in order first. What would y’all recommend, Reddit? TL;DR I have “hot and warm” feelings towards my boyfriend. Can’t figure out why."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

While the post mentions dealing with cold weather and a police report, the tone is neutral and factual.

"Consider this post: ""When moving into their tiny house, they would be given a state I.D. with that tiny house's address on it as well as a list of strict rules they have to follow lest they lose some privileges or even be evicted from their house depending on the rules broken. So basically they won't be homeless anymore but ""homed"" which is why the place would be called ""Homed"". Anyway, the homed will have to pay rent for their tiny homes by either getting a job (which is why it is important for them to get a state I.D.) or doing volunteer work around the community (e.g."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

"Consider this post: ""More specifically, for example, I live with roommates and I can't remember the last time it has been quiet in the apartment. There's never a moment where it is completely silent and I know it's anxiety and sensory overload, but gosh does it make me angry. My roommates talk CONSTANTLY and they keep me from being able to sleep because all I can concentrate on is their voices. Another example, in one of my classes today, my professor talked non-stop and she's one of those extremely hyper, fast talking, off topic teachers who go off on tangents about things that aren't related to the lesson at all. It was so hard to stay in that class without storming out because I couldn't handle listening to her loud voice any longer.""

The post describes frustration and anger due to constant noise from roommates and sensory overload in a classroom setting.

"Consider this post: ""Long story short my family in NE Ohio is abusive as hell so I had to leave the state and stay with family down south. It isn't working out and they're sending me packing to Ohio because I guess I'm a financial problem even though I got a job here. I have nowhere I can stay. I'm even getting rid of my beloved cat so I can have options. I can't go back to my family in Ohio."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. The post reveals multiple stressors: fleeing an abusive family, being sent back to an unsafe situation due to financial strain, having 'nowhere to stay,' and the painful decision to give up a beloved pet.

"Consider this post: ""This new ""roommate"" lived 3 hours away in an post code envious town and seemed super sweet, funny and SUPER handsome with a successful career mapped out in front of him. I agreed to meet him for dinner half way between our homes, in San Leandro.. He showed up with roses, a million watt smile and a full arsenal of lies. Within 5 days he had made the journey to personally escort me and my belongings to his personal prison he had concocted for his next victim - me.. The first week he was sweet, attentive,... almost too kind.. Then one morning it all changed."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress.
