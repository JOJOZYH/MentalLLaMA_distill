Another example, in one of my classes today, my professor talked non-stop and she's one of those extremely hyper, fast talking, off topic teachers who go off on tangents about things that aren't related to the lesson at all.

I felt a real connection with Post Hardcore/ Alternative. During this time I knew of Anxiety, but I didn't know OF it. In other words, I considered it a personality trait and not something treatable, more or less just apart of me.

"Consider this post: ""But I just can’t do what I need to do because I am terrified that I am doing the “wrong” thing, regardless of what decision I make. But the current situation (doing nothing) is extremely detrimental as well. I feel like a total loser and I am deeply ashamed of this anxiety, though I know that it is nothing to be ashamed of. I’m confident in so many areas of my life, but anxiety targets me and I become immovable. This is one of those times."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster explicitly describes feelings of terror, shame, and paralysis due to anxiety.

I don't even know how to feel yet my girlfriend says I'm selfless to a fault how I can be I don't know she always says she wishes she could have rescued kid me from my mother and has been the saint of a women that is still by my side and still wants to marry me. How and why I don't know I feel worthless ans like I have nothing to offer up other than my love and the constant promise I'll never leave her.

"Consider this post: ""Regarding my abuser, I still feel my heart ache with compassion, and the understanding that no human being is born a monster; it is an environment poisoned with violence they grew up in that guides them into life as an abuser. I have prayed every single day for John Doe and his foster family, in the hopes that he can overcome his inner demons and lead a life of peace. But if and when he finds a new woman to victimize and rob her of dignity, worth, and benevolence, I feel proud that I have taken steps to ensure that even if she is too afraid to step forward, I have taken that first step in her honor. I feel proud to have set the precedent to lead him on a path for growth and healing if he chooses. I feel proud to have broken that silence.""

"Consider this post: ""His consequences will never reflect or equate to the suffering I have endured and the life-long trauma that will impede on the rest of my life. Because on March 21st and 22nd in 2017, my humanity was shaken and distorted in ways that I still struggle to resolve. It exists in the shadows of nightmares I still have of his face, his screams, his weapons, his murder threats, suicide threats, and fists. It is perpetuated by the adrenaline and primal fear I have when I see vehicles that look like his. It is in my mind when I have to loop around my neighborhood before going home, out of fear that I will see him, because he ONLY lives 5 minutes from me."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post vividly describes ongoing trauma and fear stemming from past abuse. The poster mentions nightmares, adrenaline responses, and avoidance behaviors (e.g., looping around the neighborhood to avoid the abuser).

"Consider this post: ""I'll try to keep this short. I've never been able to feel empathy towards other people, I'm not a sociopath or anything (as far as I know), I know when I should feel bad for/with somebody but I can't make myself care as much as I want to. _ Anyways, my mothers best friend of 45 years just killed himself and she's pretty torn up about it. I gave her a hug and what not but I have no idea what else I'm supposed to do."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress.

Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of exhaustion and helplessness regarding the drawn-out nature of their breakups.

"Consider this post: ""He also tortured me in several other ways, like subduing me and pressing his knee into my temple or heatbutting me in the nose as a way to start a fight. I started taking martial arts and self defense classes and I started retaliating against him, when I was around 15. He'd also hit my mom sometimes and I'd protect her. One time while trying to avoid his chokes I cut my head so bad that blood was gushing all over the room - and when I got him off me, he came back and headbutted me in the nose and tried to choke me again, after which I threw him over the table. The whole room was covered in my blood and he was still relentless."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post recounts severe physical and emotional abuse, including violent altercations and trauma. The detailed descriptions of violence and the poster's retaliatory actions indicate deep emotional and psychological distress, which are clear markers of stress and trauma."
"Consider this post: ""My ""symptoms"": I know this probably isn't nothing compared what other people go through. I even thought this didn't affect me, I thought most people go through either the same or worse, until I was about 20 years old. But once every day, or every 2-3 days, I get intense, intrusive memories about these events. I feel extreme anger and hate, my heart rate goes sky high, sometimes even my hands start shaking."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. The description of intense, intrusive memories accompanied by extreme anger, hate, elevated heart rate, and physical symptoms like shaking hands indicates significant emotional and physiological distress. The frequency of these episodes (daily or every 2-3 days) further underscores the ongoing nature of their stress."
"Consider this post: ""Like, I don't think they happen if I distract myself with the Internet or doing some hobby that I like.  I remember feeling like this at least once a week ever since I was around 15 or so.   I used to have nightmares about either fighting for life with my brother or my dad or someone else, or about seizures happening to me or people around me every day. Now I have them maybe once a week or two. I get something that feels like an adrenaline rush when I'm bringing this up, for instance as I'm writing this, or when my brother decides to visit my mom, and sometimes it just happens randomly."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. While they mention past nightmares and occasional adrenaline rushes, the tone of the post is more reflective and less indicative of current distress.

"Consider this post: ""Throwaway, changed names, etc... My ex and i dated for about 2 years and had an incredible relationship.

"Consider this post: ""My girlfriend and I have been amazingly strong for the last 8 months, shortly before new years she told me that she feels very much in ""love"" with me but ""doesnt feel right"". She wanted an unknown amount of time away from the relationship saying only a couple of weeks and still wanted to keep the same ground rules as when were together (monogomous, etc..) Shes vague when i try and talk to her about it, stating she just feels like somethings wrong and that shes doing this so she can fix her self and come back to 'us' stronger I talked to her again last night and as always shes adamant this is because she loves me and wants us to work more then anything... Shes never lied to me before, not even over little things so i have no reason to doubt her intentions.

"Consider this post: ""I was younger than 13 during my period of abuse and one thing I'm noticing now is that I can't wrap my head around consent. People tell me that I couldn't possibly consent to anything that happened, even if I asked for it. That I didn't even know what was happening to me. It doesn't feel that way to me. On paper, I get that."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The post reflects the poster's struggle to reconcile their personal feelings about their past abuse with the external perspective that they couldn't have consented due to their age.

"Consider this post: ""That's why I've come to you guys. \- If the formatting is weird, it's because it's midnight and I've edited this damn thing so many times I want to cut off my own hands so I can't torture myself with editing it any more. It's probably garbled af. Yes, I did proofread it, but I can't guarantee quality because it's midnight lmao. I'm super tired.""

I already had anger issues before this, due to traumatic brain injuries, and now I feel a paradoxical combination of extreme rage/complete emptiness, etc."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post describes intense emotional pain following the sudden death of a best friend and another recent tragedy.

"Consider this post: ""I told him that even though I prefer living on the west coast, I am willing to try living anywhere in the country except for DC, and even then I could do another year or so there, but I couldn’t fathom the idea of spending my life, setting down roots, and starting a family there. He doesn’t seem keen on the idea of doing anything else. I guess I’m just looking for some perspective. After having this big talk we both expressed that we really, really don’t want to break up. Then I begin thinking, if I’m unwilling to move back to DC, and he’s willing to place this notion of an ideal career ahead of me, do we really love each other that much?""

Reasoning: The post discusses a disagreement about living locations and career priorities, but the tone is more reflective and seeking perspective rather than conveying distress or emotional turmoil.

"Consider this post: ""Last week while my girlfriend was out of the country I noticed our puppy Luca wasn't acting himself. I took him to the emergency clinic and after some tests they told me he would require immediate surgery or we were at a high risk of losing him.

Regardless of who messages me (family, friends, strangers) I avoid opening the message (text message, email, social media message, calls, voicemails) and avoid replying until hours later or even the next day. I don’t know why I do this, but I feel like it takes so much of my energy to open the message and reply and it’s almost like I don’t want to have a continuous conversation with anyone. It’s very bad for trying to maintain healthy relationships. Does anyone else suffer with this from anxiety?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress.

Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster is in a situation where they are preparing to leave a relationship discreetly, which is inherently stressful.

"Consider this post: ""I stuck it out because I didn't have the means to leave and I had a hard time accepting it was abuse. I tried to change my behaviour, but nothing was ever good enough. It was a typical narcissistic and empath relationship. I slowly realized even if I was wrong, it didn't warrant this treatment. Cue months of gaslighting that I was suffering from ppd (this may be somewhat true, but didn't dismiss the fact that he was also abusive.)"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes enduring an abusive relationship, which is a significant source of emotional and psychological stress.

"Consider this post: ""I have reduced my drinking a ton since i started it and by the second week I could already feel a major improvement in my anxiety and mental clarity, but it may have been largely due to my reduction in alcohol. In the past three days I have felt myself beginning to spiral and today I am feeling very very dark, very disconnected. I am such a low dosage I am wondering if maybe it's just not working and what I thought was it working was actually just reducing the alcohol intake?

Reasoning: The poster describes a severe decline in mental health, including feelings of darkness, disconnection, and urges to self-harm or drink.

She told me she had just gotten out a relationship before we met, and didn't intend to have such strong feelings for me and now she is just scared. I actually ended up really liking her which has been rare for me lately, so this is something i would like to hold on to if at all salvageable. The problem is we barely text (once a week or so), and have not hung out since that party. Is this a case of 'Just not that into you' so she's just trying to be nice?""

Told me it was moving too quickly and she was scared that it was headed toward something she wasn't ready for.

The reason why he broke up with me is that this coming semester, he will be working/in class for 12 hours a day and he doesn’t want to put me through that, since he won’t have enough time to give me. He then said that he didn’t think this would be the last time we spoke, and that we would somehow find our way back into each other’s lives eventually."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

To start off, I remember it being the start off 2015 and I was sleeping over at my best friends house who we will call ""J"". Now J and I would always stay up all night when having sleepovers, and this certain night I managed to pull through to 6:30 am 30 minutes after J had fallen asleep, though when I woke up I was in his sisters bed. Now since then up until now, I just assumed that I was literally half asleep and that I was just looking for anywhere comfortable to sleep that wasn't taken in my literally half asleep state of mind (both his sisters had stayed up all night in the living room I've believed up until this moment, also something to keep in mind is that both of us were to young to be consuming alcohol and I have no memory of myself entering their room.""

I think spending time with other people than me is good for her, but she is so afraid of ruining things for others.

It culminated in the allegations of cheating and the choking), and that's the last thing we want. Better the devil you know and your enemies close or something.""

Some things that have led me to think I may have anxiety: I've been performing on stages for all of my life, but I still find my heart racing and knees weak every time I'm on stage. One time, I messed up a performance, and when I saw my peers the next day, I had to remove myself from the situation and go to a place where I could be alone. I don't mind public speaking though.""

However, my sister always sneaks alcohol into the house anyway, and is drunk by nightfall. Then the arguments start.

My ex-roommate(who had PTSD from fighting in Iraq and BPD) became jealous that I was hanging out with and spending all my time with a man that was not him, he began to hide my prescription anxiety and sleep medication so I would have to spend more time at my apartment and with him.

"Consider this post: ""I'd never heard this idea until recently, and I'm starting to see it cropping up more, always in opposition to any kind of support (or even empathy) for the homeless - any attempt to help the homeless is pointless because 'most' homeless people want to be homeless; therefore housing programs/assistance, mental health & substance abuse support are wasted because the homeless are too lazy to get themselves out of homelessness and 'enjoy' their condition, because they don't have to work, because they don't have to pay bills, because they don't have responsibilities, because they're lazy etc. I strenuously disagree with this, and I feel like it's an attempt to move the goalposts; there's a growing awareness that homeless people may not necessarily be homeless because they got themselves into that position and they 'deserve' it, but because of substance abuse issues and mental health problems, coupled with a breakdown in social network. But that's a lie, or 'lefty propaganda', for some people; they want to believe, despite whatever legitimate reasons some homeless may have for not being in shelters, say, that it's a *moral failing* \- going full circle, they don't deserve help because their homelessness is a consequence of decisions they made. Thoughts?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

This is in no way her fault, she has done nothing to deserve my questioning of my decision, this is my problem and mine alone. I am reluctant to bring this up with her because I'm worried that she might break up with me because I do truly still love her I'm just wondering if this other girl is a passing thought more focused than earlier and something I can overcome.""

If my anxiety oscillated between normal followed by panic, I wouldn’t feel so confused and constantly question what I should be doing right now. There aren’t any damn patterns.

People say that I'm a great person and easily liked but I don't realize sometimes how my expression and tone may come off, and people naturally give me a benefit of a doubt that I'm just passionate. My jealousy is extreme, and it causes me to be a questioning type but I use subtle ways to get information so it appears as normal a  question because I have attachment issues and fear of loss. There is more to explain but I got to the bare bottom of the issue after realizing these habits."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: While the poster describes intense emotions, jealousy, and attachment issues, the tone of the post is more self-analytical and reflective rather than distressed.

"Consider this post: ""I realized how small nuances subconsciously give me thoughts without me feeding into it. They feed into itself and I watch it do it all on its own, and it causes responses in my body and anxiety without trying. It's almost as is if another person is living in here but what it is, it's all instinctual. The awareness has given me a better grasp on things but it feels like an illness now with this new perspective because it comes over me like one. It's like being drugged and having no control over the effects, and you have no choice but to let it occur, and you fight any urges it gives you, although you may be aware of it happening.""

Now in college however I dread presentations.

I googled it and it says that that specific program is for a very different demographic living in group homes.

I'm not your ex, I don't think it's fair of you to compare me to him like that all the time. She says she's ""not used to being single,"" it kind of makes me feel like she's using me to get reassurance and validation.""

I’ve been super depressed and I’m scared for what I’ll do to myself if I don’t get out or if I do get out of this  and have to live a life without him .

"Consider this post: ""I may try a new medication. Antidepressants were ok but kind of turned into an unfeeling zombie, which wasn’t good either. It’s hard to describe, but the vigilance goes beyond traditional anxiety and it can be embarrassing.

Has anyone had luck with medication that soothes you enough, without making you groggy or disconnected?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's struggles with medication side effects (feeling like a 'zombie') and heightened vigilance beyond traditional anxiety.

"Consider this post: ""He would refuse to kiss me or touch me because I was a contaminant and he would obsess about how clean and lovely Japanese idols are, etc. He would often say to me that if he ever met an Asian woman he would dump me immediately. The sexual requirements were a very stringent hygiene ritual, followed with putting on one of his idol videos and I would dress as whatever the girl was wearing such as a maid costume or whatever. He would keep his eyes on the screen while I basically gave him a blow job.

I, my wife and daughter would appreciate any help to tide us over."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: While the post outlines financial and logistical challenges, the tone is matter-of-fact and focused on seeking practical help rather than expressing emotional distress. The poster does not convey feelings of stress or anxiety."
"Consider this post: ""I was so sure that tattooing was the career I wanted to get into but after completing the apprenticeship and even working as a tattoo artist AND piercer for about a year, I find myself still fucking miserable. Maybe even worse than before. The first tattoo shop I worked for was great but I had to move and I struggled finding another shop like that one. The owner of the last shop I worked in was just a total fucking asshole and treated me like dirt. There's a lot more detail with that story but to make it short, the entire experience made me terrified of going into tattoo shops now."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses deep dissatisfaction and misery with their chosen career path, despite initial enthusiasm. The negative experience with a previous employer, described as a 'total fucking asshole,' has left them terrified of tattoo shops, indicating significant emotional distress. The tone of the post conveys frustration, fear, and a sense of hopelessness, all of which are strong indicators of stress."
"Consider this post: ""He doesn't let me have any friends i have one from highschool and he's been trying to get me to stop talking to her. saying she just has bad intentions and isnt a true friend but i know diff shes a good person. She recently asked me to start going to the gym with her and i said yes at first, but i told my husband and he flipped. Then he goes you dont need to and all this other stuff but right befour i told him he grabs my fat and says jiggle jiggle...Which just tells me.. you need to lose some weight which i do, I know ive gained alot since having our son...Or yesterday i was craving chips and i told him i was going to the store to get some things and he says.. No! go run around the house.. and continues on what hes doing."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes a controlling and demeaning relationship with their husband, who restricts their social interactions, criticizes their body, and dismisses their desires (e.g., denying them chips and suggesting exercise instead). The language used ('flipped,' 'jiggle jiggle,' 'No! go run around the house') reflects emotional manipulation and belittlement, which are clear sources of stress. The poster's awareness of their weight gain and their husband's harsh comments further contribute to their emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""I feel like the trust I worked so hard to build and the work I put in improving myself by going to therapy, dealing with the anger and the fact I was quick to be violent (old habits die hard...), dealing with and accepting the fact I've also got ADHD and autism, becoming a better man and not following in the footsteps of my dad is just... gone. Destroyed. Utterly fucked. I feel betrayed and completely alone because she was the only person I trusted on this entire planet. I can't even look at her even 4 days later and I've barely spoken to her since."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post reveals intense emotional pain stemming from a perceived betrayal by someone they deeply trusted. The poster describes feeling like their personal growth and efforts to improve themselves (therapy, managing anger, accepting neurodivergence) have been 'destroyed.' The phrases 'utterly fucked,' 'betrayed,' and 'completely alone' highlight profound distress. The inability to even look at or speak to the person further underscores their emotional turmoil."
"Consider this post: ""I am called back as a few secondary characters in a play with plenty leads and these character have one line each and sometimes no lines at all so I’m basically ensemble again. To top that off I got called back as the same four characters that like 13 girls are going to compete for and one of them is a new girl in school that this was her first audition. I’m a bit jealous and I know I shouldn’t be but I’m not jealous that the new girl got in, it’s a mix of jealousy and disappointment and dissatisfaction in myself. Plus these two guys that I might have a slight crush on are called back for main characters that kiss the leads in the play so I’m a bit mad about that too. Sorry for ranting so much and I might sound like a bitch but I just need some place to rant and this felt like the best place for it since I’m so stressed and mad at myself about this."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses frustration and self-directed anger over their perceived lack of success in a play audition, feeling overshadowed by others (e.g., a new girl getting callbacks). They admit to jealousy, disappointment, and dissatisfaction with themselves, compounded by romantic frustrations (crushes kissing leads). The explicit mention of being 'so stressed and mad at myself' confirms their heightened emotional state."
"Consider this post: ""This lead to a series of tests which basically showed that he had developmental issues and as he only ever eats junk food and soda showed that hes pretty much decaying. He has some memory issues now and can't really be trusted to live on his own like he could but he'd need a care taker to come in once a week to make sure he's eating, hasn't burned the house down, etc. Anyways I bring this up because at this time in life I was praying to God to kill him or to at least get him out of our lives so I took this incident as either A)Gods way of making me eat my words or B)This was the answer to my prayers as he technically is dying by grdual decay.....slowly"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: While the post describes a difficult situation involving a family member's health decline, the tone is more reflective and detached. The poster frames the situation as either a cosmic lesson ('Gods way of making me eat my words') or a grim answer to prayers ('dying by gradual decay'). There is no overt expression of personal distress or emotional overwhelm; instead, the focus is on the factual and philosophical implications of the scenario."
"Consider this post: ""We've funnelled about 4k into saving our dog's life. As you can see- we haven't gotten that in donations, but what we've gotten has really saved our asses. I found out my dog had a 'treatable' disease right after graduating from college. The college debt was already a burden, and after my partner got laid off- the panic set in that we would have to put my best friend down. He's too young for this, and has been too good to us."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post describes multiple stressors, including significant financial strain from saving their dog's life, the burden of college debt, and the partner's recent layoff. The emotional attachment to the dog and the fear of having to euthanize a young and beloved pet add to the distress. The phrase 'the panic set in' explicitly indicates heightened stress and anxiety."
"Consider this post: ""I went through sexual assault less than a year ago and I still find I have flashbacks, I get anxious over it. I don’t tell many people this. I told one friend and a few days ago we got into an argument and he ended up saying that it was my fault it happened. I haven’t talked to him since and I’ve deleted his number, but he keeps messaging me as if nothing happened. Am I being irrational in ignoring him for this or is he just an asshole?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post reveals ongoing trauma from a recent sexual assault, including flashbacks and anxiety. The additional emotional blow of a trusted friend blaming them for the assault exacerbates the distress. The poster's actions (deleting the friend's number and ignoring messages) suggest emotional turmoil and a need to protect themselves, further indicating stress."
"Consider this post: ""I’m  asking yall how can I live life properly? Immediately after I threw up  in year 2, I never feared it happening again. I admit when this happened  I was in tears, and same in year 3- I was crying next to my mum by the  toilet but it was over quick and again- I was eating chocolate again the  day after. But now, nausea? Stop eating for the day."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: While the post describes past experiences of vomiting and nausea, the tone is more reflective and observational rather than distressed. The poster acknowledges crying in the past but focuses on the transient nature of the episodes and their ability to resume normal activities (e.g., eating chocolate the next day). There is no indication of ongoing emotional or situational stress."
"Consider this post: ""I set up this go fund me page today after learning about the tragic accident that changed my friend and his family's lives forever. Tyson owns his own construction business where he and 2 others work. Last week one of his coworkers died of heat stroke in Tyson's front yard. Saturday June 2, 2018 Tyson was in a car accident where he rolled his vehicle and was ejected. He has over 20 broken/fractured bones and internal bleeding."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The post is a factual account of a tragic accident involving a friend and his family. While the events described are undoubtedly stressful for the friend and his family, the poster's tone is neutral and focused on sharing information to solicit support (via a GoFundMe page). There is no personal expression of emotional distress or overwhelm from the poster themselves."
"Consider this post: ""I'm sorry if I didn't post this in the right place and such, it'd be really comforting if someone had this as well and told me about it. edit: another way to describe it may be a million thoughts at once. it's really irritable. It's not like I'm thinking ""what if"" as I have seen many people describe, it's just random things, imagine 100 TV channels playing at once and you know what none of them are about or to do with you. It's also very sudden, like an attack."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The post describes a sensation of overwhelming and random thoughts, likened to '100 TV channels playing at once,' but the tone is more inquisitive and seeking reassurance rather than distressed. The poster is asking if others experience similar phenomena, suggesting curiosity or concern rather than acute stress. The lack of emotional language (e.g., fear, panic, or helplessness) further supports this conclusion."
"Consider this post: ""I see her as a distressed and confused, hurting person. In part, this was out of my hands. They filed on my behalf. But the guilt of all this will do to her is hard to deal with. I'll keep breathing and moving forward."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post reflects feelings of guilt and concern for another person's distress, which indicates emotional burden. The statement 'the guilt of all this will do to her is hard to deal with' explicitly mentions difficulty coping with these emotions. Additionally, the resolve to 'keep breathing and moving forward' suggests an ongoing struggle, further supporting the presence of stress."
"Consider this post: ""My mood has been worse because it’s so fucking hot in the uk and I feel sticky and gross 24/7 unless I’m in the shower. Maybe dehydration is the reason behind my depressed anxious feeling? I really thought the meds were helping me before this so I don’t want to give up on them....but I don’t know what to expect right now. Sorry for going on too much, advice would be amazing right now. ❤️"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post describes a decline in mood due to physical discomfort from heat, feelings of stickiness, and potential dehydration. The mention of 'depressed anxious feeling' and uncertainty about medication effectiveness highlights emotional distress. The plea for advice ('advice would be amazing right now') further underscores their need for support, indicating stress."
"Consider this post: ""This has only started in the last few days. My mood has been worse because it’s so fucking hot in the uk and I feel sticky and gross 24/7 unless I’m in the shower. Maybe dehydration is the reason behind my depressed anxious feeling? I really thought the meds were helping me before this so I don’t want to give up on them....but I don’t know what to expect right now. Sorry for going on too much, advice would be amazing right now."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post is identical to Q2, reiterating the same stressors: worsened mood due to heat, physical discomfort ('sticky and gross'), and anxiety linked to dehydration. The uncertainty about medication and request for advice ('Sorry for going on too much, advice would be amazing right now') reinforce the presence of emotional distress and stress."
"Consider this post: ""Hold on, this is going to be a long one folks. I met Alex at work about a year ago. We collaborated on few projects being in similar roles but never worked directly on the same team. When I first met him, I wasn't romantically interested in him. I was in a relationship and I knew the age difference and it was just not something that would be on my radar."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The post is a neutral narrative about meeting someone at work and initial lack of romantic interest. There are no expressions of emotional distress, anxiety, or overwhelming feelings. The tone is factual and retrospective, lacking any indicators of stress."
"Consider this post: ""The second half of a song called Monsters, by the band NOFX. A favorite of mine, it seems appropriate. I never had the guts to do it. But God how I wanted to run off. God give me strength"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: While the post references a song about inner struggles ('God how I wanted to run off'), the tone is reflective rather than distressed. The mention of 'God give me strength' could imply resilience or contemplation, but there are no explicit signs of current emotional turmoil or stress in the language used."
"Consider this post: ""If I am to survive I must defy him I'm leaving this behind I'll go so far away He'll never find me I know that I'm Making that the last time"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The post reads more like a declaration of defiance and determination to leave a situation behind. The tone is resolute and focused on action (e.g., 'I'm leaving this behind,' 'I'll go so far away'), rather than expressing emotional distress or turmoil. There is no indication of anxiety, fear, or overwhelming pressure, which are typical markers of stress."
"Consider this post: ""But Kim Jong Un has already fired more missile than his dad and grandpa combined. How worried do I need to be on the East Coast of the USA? I'm trying to calm down with breathing exercises and busting my mind with Netflix. It's helping a bit, but I'm really on edge. I've got an appointment with my doctor next week, so I'm hoping maybe a higher dose of medicine can help."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses significant worry about geopolitical events ('How worried do I need to be on the East Coast of the USA?') and describes being 'on edge.' They mention using coping mechanisms like breathing exercises and Netflix to calm down, which suggests they are actively trying to manage their anxiety. Additionally, the fact that they are seeking medical help ('hoping maybe a higher dose of medicine can help') further indicates they are experiencing stress or anxiety that is impacting their well-being."
"Consider this post: ""At the end of the night he literally dragged her to the end and caught a cab home by themselves. I didn’t think of anything as he was telling me that she would act up sometimes. But this time it was something different. My gf started crying all the way home, telling me how she told her that my friend “S” beats her. It took me a while to realize what she was telling me."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post describes a highly emotional and distressing situation involving a friend's alleged abusive behavior ('my friend “S” beats her'). The poster's girlfriend is crying, and the poster themselves seems shaken ('It took me a while to realize what she was telling me'), which suggests they are processing a traumatic revelation. The emotional weight of the situation and the implied concern for their friend's well-being are clear indicators of stress."
"Consider this post: ""The first two times I had done these psychedelics I was mostly alone, the last one however was with my friends. So me and two of my closest friends (let's call them Joseph and Andy) took our tabs in a pretty comfortable setting (as has been suggested by most who have taken these drugs). It was at Joseph's apartment. About an hour later Andy has definitely been hit the strongest with him being the most talkative and I the least. The visuals were amazing as usual and the sound is also distorted as usual."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The post describes a psychedelic experience in a positive and controlled setting ('a pretty comfortable setting'). The tone is neutral to reflective, focusing on the sensory and social aspects of the experience ('The visuals were amazing as usual'). There is no mention of negative emotions, anxiety, or distress, and the overall narrative suggests a lack of stress during the event."
"Consider this post: ""This weekend was terrible, and I guess I wanted to talk about it. Even before this I've been a bit detached and increasingly jumpy. Any sudden sounds or movements I don't expect make me jump. Sometimes I startle so hard I actually pull a shoulder muscle. This weekend though just was worse than usual..."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster explicitly describes heightened anxiety ('increasingly jumpy,' 'Any sudden sounds or movements I don't expect make me jump') and physical reactions to stress ('startle so hard I actually pull a shoulder muscle'). They also characterize the weekend as 'terrible' and worse than usual, indicating a significant escalation in their stress levels. The post conveys a sense of being overwhelmed and unable to cope with their current state."
"Consider this post: ""This may be a ridiculous question, but I feel like I go to pee way to many times more than average and It's starting to make me insane. I wanted to get this out of my mind. I think it may be a psychological problem, like an anxiety ""symptom"". Because when I'm at home for an entire day, it's fine. But when I'm in school or in any other public place I get that thought: ""What if I suddenly have to go while I'm doing an exam?"""" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses concern about frequent urination, particularly in public places like school, and links it to anxiety. The fear of needing to go during an exam indicates heightened stress and anxiety in specific situations, which affects their daily functioning."
"Consider this post: ""I asked for nothing but a declaration (a document detailing finances) from the divorce. He stole from me. I asked for nothing but restitution. He fought, forced me to hire a lawyer (more money), dragged out the case, and led to have alimony imposed upon if he failed to make restitution. He still failed to even honestly attempt to make restitution."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post describes a contentious divorce where the poster feels wronged and financially burdened. The language used ('stole from me,' 'forced me to hire a lawyer,' 'dragged out the case') conveys frustration, betrayal, and ongoing emotional and financial strain, all indicative of significant stress."
"Consider this post: ""At the very least, I need help keeping the RV running so that I can get food at least, keep going to the doctor to see if I can get well enough to work again. And if i end up filing for bankruptcy and lose my home (as might happen in the next month or two, to be honest), I'll need it to sleep in. So if anyone to help out even a little bit with this $575, I could really use it. Thank you! Update:"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: While the post outlines financial and health challenges, the tone is more factual and focused on seeking practical help (e.g., keeping the RV running, bankruptcy concerns). There is no explicit expression of emotional distress or overwhelming anxiety, suggesting the poster is managing the situation pragmatically."
"Consider this post: ""Hey guys. This post is primarily obsession and compulsion orientated. I did want to post in the OCD sr but it’s pretty quiet in there. I’m a 19 year old male from the UK and in terms of my anxiety, this has truly been the worst year of my life. My most common obsession theme throughout my life has been to do with my health but for the last two years I have been dominated by intrusive thoughts about being a homosexual when I’m not and being a pedophile."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post explicitly mentions severe anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and obsessive-compulsive themes, describing it as 'the worst year of my life.' The distress over unwanted thoughts about sexuality and identity strongly indicates significant psychological stress."
"Consider this post: ""If you don't, find one. It helps so much and may be the only way I have gotten this far. I think it is just so scary because there is nothing that feels like this isn't just how life is from now on. I feel like I fight every day just to be able to be this crappy shadow of the guy I used to be. I feel like there is nothing to look forward to, and all I have is just trying to fail at everything in the least humiliating way that I can."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The language reflects profound hopelessness ('nothing to look forward to,' 'crappy shadow of the guy I used to be') and a daily struggle to cope. The sentiment of fighting to avoid humiliation and feeling trapped in a bleak reality underscores chronic emotional distress and stress."
"Consider this post: ""I’m not afraid of this guy, at all, and I have no idea what brought this reaction on, but I’m humiliated and feel terrible. I kept telling him I was so sorry but I just felt like an idiot, and I didn’t want to get into my past because it gets heavy. I just feel like I will never be normal again, I don’t know if I should talk about it, I’m frustrated. Any advice? I feel damaged."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. The post reveals feelings of humiliation, frustration, and a sense of being 'damaged.' The poster expresses uncertainty about their emotional state ('I don’t know if I should talk about it') and a fear of never being 'normal again,' which indicates significant emotional distress. The plea for advice further underscores their feelings of helplessness and stress."
"Consider this post: ""I sent a respectful email to my primary psychiatrist explaining my thoughts on how it was inappropriate to have Paterno's picture prominently displayed. Am I fucked up in the head for thinking this wrong? In the past, I had a mild traumatic brain injury. Sometimes I over react. 24 hours post appointment, I'm still bitter about the Paterno pics."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. While the post mentions a past traumatic brain injury and some lingering bitterness about an appointment, the tone is more reflective and questioning ('Am I fucked up in the head for thinking this wrong?') rather than distressed. There is no strong indication of ongoing emotional turmoil or overwhelming stress."
"Consider this post: ""In a day I went from broke and facing a dark, foreclosed home with no utilities to having enough money to totally catch up on all my bills. Then I had an appointment with my psychiatrist and case worker at the clinic I go to. I shamefully told the doctor there that I had been out of control, off meds, binging on alcohol and not following advice. She explained that it was not surprising for someone with my condition to lose control with all the stress I was facing. She increased my prozac dose and made appointments to follow up and see a therapist and reassured me about many things."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Although the post describes a period of financial instability and personal struggles (being off meds, binge drinking), the current tone is one of resolution and support. The poster has caught up on bills, received medical help, and has a plan for follow-up care. The psychiatrist's reassurance and the structured support suggest the poster is now in a more stable and less stressful situation."
"Consider this post: ""So I had to look for work again. She gave me hell the entire time. I just found another job at the end of February, but my start date wouldn't be till near the end of march. That wasn't good enough for her (as if I set the start date), so she breaks up with me, and kicks me out. Now I'm fucked, because I have work."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. The post describes a series of stressful events, including job loss, a difficult breakup, and being kicked out of their home. The use of strong language ('Now I'm fucked') and the sense of being overwhelmed by circumstances ('That wasn't good enough for her') clearly indicate significant stress and emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""It was a higher amount previously, but I've been figuring things out each day to get by. At this point I may have exhausted all options. I can repay the money along with some interest once I get paid. Although I'd love to split that between this pay and next months if possible. If not, that's ok too."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. The post discusses financial challenges but adopts a pragmatic and solution-oriented tone ('I've been figuring things out each day to get by'). The poster expresses flexibility and acceptance ('If not, that's ok too'), which suggests they are managing the situation without significant emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""I really need to get this off my chest because I don't feel like anyone I can talk to in ""real life"" right now is going to understand (I am seeing friends Wednesday though). I had a horrible weekend. Boyfriend and I want to move next year. This weekend we visited a city we were thinking about moving to and we **hated** it. I was so discouraged and feeling so vulnerable by the whole thing."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses feelings of discouragement and vulnerability after a disappointing experience during a weekend trip to a potential new city. The strong negative reaction ('we **hated** it') and the lack of immediate support from people in their real life contribute to their emotional distress. The anticipation of moving, combined with this setback, likely exacerbates their stress."
"Consider this post: ""The news is always problematic for folks with PTSD, but it just feels so much worse lately. I am not one to regularly get triggered by the news, but this weekend just was too much. I just felt like I was swept into this gigantic downward spiral. I really want to go clean up my room and get some food ready for tomorrow (the work week) (AKA do some ""adulating"") but I am so exasperated, exhausted, and burnt out that I just can't. And that is going to make the week even worse."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post highlights multiple stressors, including being triggered by the news (exacerbated by PTSD), feeling overwhelmed ('downward spiral'), and being unable to perform basic tasks like cleaning or meal prep due to exhaustion. The poster's sense of burnout and the anticipation of a difficult work week further indicate significant stress."
"Consider this post: ""But she then came out of the bathroom a second time and attached me saying she was going to fucking kill me and started choking me. I did push her back against bathroom door just to restrain her. Not to hit her Just to try to figure out what was going on. It was the 3rd time i was attacked in 24 hours. I was scared."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes a physically violent altercation where they were attacked and choked, which is inherently traumatic. The repeated nature of the attacks ('3rd time in 24 hours') and the explicit mention of fear ('I was scared') clearly demonstrate acute stress and emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""The online therapist who was helping me through by depressive anxiety disorder ghosted on me without furnishing a reason. What's worse is I spent a majority of my waking time in the office and I feel so alone and out of place there. I would love to have somebody I can trust but theres always something. Ugh can't keep doing this. I've not been getting sleep over this feeling."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster mentions multiple stressors, including being ghosted by their therapist (a critical support figure), feeling isolated at work, and lacking trusted connections. The phrase 'Ugh can't keep doing this' and sleep disturbances due to these feelings further underscore their high level of stress."
"Consider this post: ""But yeah, I was afraid and dumb and feeling vulnerable when I wrote it. So thanks to you guys for calming me, and sharing your own stories (really helped alot). tldr : I was sooper stoopid, but me and my dad are still cool. But thank you to everyone who calmed me down on here when I posted. It meant alot."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The post reflects a resolved situation where the poster acknowledges past fear and vulnerability but expresses gratitude for support received ('thanks to you guys for calming me').

"Consider this post: ""Now they didn't know about HF autism then but the signs were there. Bullied in school and at home, I just shut down at about age 10. Went to school ,went home , didn't talk to anybody. The schools noticed. Parents were duly notified but nothing was done."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post describes a history of bullying in school and at home, leading to the poster shutting down at a young age. The lack of intervention despite the schools noticing and notifying the parents suggests unresolved trauma and emotional distress. The description of shutting down and not talking to anybody indicates significant emotional withdrawal, which is often a response to prolonged stress or trauma."
"Consider this post: ""Hello everyone, A very close friend of mine was in an accident a few years ago and deals with PTSD. He has horrific nightmares that wake him up and keep him in a state of fright. We live in separate provinces, so when he does have his dreams it is difficult to comfort him. Each time he calls, and I struggle with what to say on the phone."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: While the post discusses a close friend's PTSD and the challenges of supporting them from a distance, the poster's own emotions are not the focus. The poster expresses difficulty in knowing what to say during phone calls, but this does not indicate personal stress. The concern is directed outward toward the friend's well-being rather than inward, suggesting the poster is not experiencing stress themselves."
"Consider this post: ""First things first, this may contain triggers for several different types of abuse.

I've been reaching out for potential roommates but the only person I know who's be interested can't move on a short notice and can't afford it till his car gets out of the shop.

I could meet his family, pretend to like them, pretend to bond with them and pretend to care, but that's really just lying to make him happy.

The feelings of being trapped, drained, and unable to function are strong indicators of severe stress and emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""He pretty much told me that he was angry and disappointed and would probably not forgive me for a while and that I owe him. I was going to go... I still want to. I just am looking at either going to this wedding and being evicted or not going and dealing with the disappointment. I don't feel like I have a choice."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster is facing a difficult decision, but the tone of the post is more about weighing options and dealing with disappointment rather than expressing emotional distress or turmoil. There is no clear indication of stress in the language or content of the post."
"Consider this post: ""So my brothers wedding is soon. Like very very soon. My fiance recently lost their job and we had to move and then a bunch of medical drama happened. I told him I would do everything I could to get there, I am honestly not sure if I want to go to prove I can, just because I care for my brother or because I am not being smart and compassionate enough to say no to myself. But there I was dead set on going, despite the obvious problems and the advice from the majority of the people everywhere I go that I should not go."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post outlines multiple stressors including a recent job loss, moving, medical issues, and the pressure to attend a brother's wedding despite financial and emotional strain. The internal conflict about attending the wedding ('I am honestly not sure if I want to go to prove I can, just because I care for my brother or because I am not being smart and compassionate enough to say no to myself') indicates significant emotional turmoil. The poster's insistence on going despite advice to the contrary further highlights the stress they are under."
"Consider this post: ""I hate this feeling. I hate weddings, but I want to be there to support them... but I can't. <url> &#x200B; edited; For clarity"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post expresses a strong emotional conflict between the desire to support someone at a wedding and the inability to attend, coupled with a stated hatred for weddings. The brevity and intensity of the language ('I hate this feeling. I hate weddings') suggest emotional distress. The inclusion of a URL (possibly for further context or support) and the need to edit for clarity also imply the poster is grappling with overwhelming feelings."
"Consider this post: ""I regret signing up for class especially this  math class. I feel so pathetic I may drop out again. im so anxious in class, it is so long about 6 hours since it supposed to be help special type of class to pass a placement test since I failed that. I halfway made it to my second week. I cant take it anymore."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post reveals high levels of academic anxiety and self-doubt, particularly around a math class the poster regrets enrolling in. Phrases like 'I feel so pathetic,' 'im so anxious in class,' and 'I cant take it anymore' clearly indicate emotional distress. The mention of dropping out again and the physical toll of a 6-hour class further underscore the stress the poster is experiencing."
"Consider this post: ""He wanted me to say once again that of course I was in the wrong and I need to change my selfish ways and give him the kind of love he deserves. When I stated I need space, he then demanded I be out by midnight tonight. I pointed out I would simply ask our roommate to spend 1 more night in the house as a guest. So he conceded to letting me sleep there tonight. This break up and crossroads is yet another opportunity for me to prioritize my needs in a creative and synergistic way."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post describes a contentious breakup scenario with demands for apology and immediate eviction, which are inherently stressful.

Reasoning: While the post mentions financial difficulty and a need for additional income, the tone is proactive and encouraging ('We got this!'). There is no indication of emotional distress or overwhelming anxiety; instead, the focus is on problem-solving and solidarity with others in similar situations. The absence of language expressing fear, sadness, or helplessness suggests the poster is not currently experiencing significant stress."
"Consider this post: ""I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and another mental disorder recently. I did some googling and saw that it seems that people with mental disorders as well as other disabilities are eligible to apply for Disability Cards in my countries. They include certain perks such as being allowed to go to a theme park for free. My aunt has a husband with diabetes. I sent her a screenshot of the info and asked if he could apply as well as there are perks."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. The post describes the poster researching Disability Cards and sharing information with their aunt, but there is no indication of emotional distress, anxiety, or overwhelming feelings. The tone is neutral and informational, focusing on practical matters rather than personal struggles."
"Consider this post: ""If I'm home and I'm home 50% of the time, I spend my time online with my friends. Even then, it becomes an issue. Faultily, there are days which I do spend the whole day playing with my buddies. But they were the only people I had interaction with outside of work anymore.   Btw, my girlfriend and I also work at the same place."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

For the friend in the same college, I thought that just asking her to meet up and talk would be nice, but I feel I was too persistent, and she broke all ties with me, asking me to never contact her again. The same goes with the other friend. I tried to keep in touch, but I guess my methods were totally wrong and creepy."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. The post reflects on past social interactions that did not go well, but the tone is more reflective and regretful rather than distressed or overwhelmed.

"Consider this post: ""Anything from elbowing someone in the face to completely letting loose with a knife or a baseball bat. It can be mildly amusing for a moment, but I find it actually calls up a distress response more than anything else. I start to feel my head ache, my shoulderblades become taut and sore, and my throat close. My heart rate also increases and my breathing becomes somewhat more laboured. I know this is unhealthy, and I will be addressing it with my therapist, however I was hoping to  get some input from fellow reddit users with PTSD."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes physical symptoms such as headaches, sore shoulder blades, throat constriction, increased heart rate, and labored breathing in response to distressing thoughts.

"Consider this post: ""I suffer from depression and anxiety, I didn't have the courage to tell  him no.. Although he never hit me, I was never allowed my own bank card, I wasn't allowed my car keys... He yelled and cursed at not only myself but my young children too.. One day last week, he told my legally blind son to open his fucking eyes when he couldn't find his snow pants.... That did it for me, he was gone."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes a history of emotional abuse and control, including being denied basic freedoms like having a bank card or car keys, as well as verbal abuse directed at themselves and their children. The breaking point involving their legally blind son indicates a highly stressful and traumatic environment. The poster's admission of suffering from depression and anxiety further underscores the presence of stress."

I am practicing self help. But this sort of thing is affecting me immensely."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster explicitly states that they are 'having difficulty handling' a situation involving people they know working together, and that it is 'affecting me immensely.'

"Consider this post: ""He was my best buddy in high school and we’re still really close. And my girlfriend, who goes to school in DC, is home too so I can see her. I’m grateful for them but wish I had a bigger friend group from home that I was still close to. I’ve loved college, but haven’t really found a new best friend yet. I’ve still kinda struggled with feeling like an outsider and not really fitting in."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

She’s been remembering some things from her childhood, and, with the help of her therapist, is trying to process and heal. We don’t live in the same area, and when we got together about a month ago, she filled me in on some of those issues. About a week later, she told me that she was taking a break from electronics in order to try to process and heal, and that she and her therapist had been talking about it for a while. She said she was putting her phone on airplane mode and that she’d check it in a few days and that she’d check her email about once a week.""

"Consider this post: ""Are there federal or state (IN) laws that govern shelters for shelters that don't accept any federal funds? According to a news story I have found on this shelter they don't accept federal funding, grants or any kind of corporate or foundation funds. There are so many things going on here that don't seem legal, and many more that are totally unethical. I've been here for a month and here's just a couple of the things that are jumping out at me: * Our meds are kept locked up in a cabinet in a room accessible only by staff and ""resident staff"" (which also seems like a HUGE conflict of interest.)""

Reasoning: The post is analytical and focused on legal and ethical concerns about a shelter. While the situation described may be stressful, the poster's tone is investigative and detached, with no personal emotional expression suggesting stress."
"Consider this post: ""This probably sounds super lame but I'm really, really proud of myself. I feel like this was a huge step in healing from my trauma and allowing myself to exist beyond what happened to me as a kid. I feel like one of the reasons why I felt so comfortable was because we talked a lot about boundaries and stuff beforehand, and I mentioned that I'd been sexually assaulted in the past and that I might need to stop if I start freaking out, and she was really understanding and sweet and always really communicative. Stephanie and I both agreed that we should definitely go on a second date.

"Consider this post: ""She literally said that I don’t even count as a boyfriend. --- Fastforward to now - or for the past few months to be precise, where an incredibly hot girl messages me on Tinder and asks me out. I delay meeting her and although she said she's fine waiting, she's still completely out of my league, and because I don't want to come off as desperate, I let her message me most of the time. Anyway, after a month we finally meet up, and it goes incredibly well."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The post describes a situation where the poster initially feels insecure about their relationship status and attractiveness, but the narrative shifts to a positive experience with a new romantic interest.

"Consider this post: ""Almost too well. She extends our date twice, buys us a drink each, starts a make out session which lasts for 2 hours, calls me hot, and although neither of us had a house free she gave me oral too. Although she said she had a great time - which I replied to - I then waited to respond to her next message, and I don't know if that killed any momentum because I was already very delayed when we first got talking of course. Anyway, despite our great date and a second one lined up when I asked her out a day later, she ended up cancelling on me, and then told me a week later that she got more serious with another guy - which to me only translated as him being hot and me being ugly. They broke things off a week later, and she did ask me out again, but at one stage I annoyed her with a jokey message."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post reveals feelings of insecurity and self-doubt, particularly around attractiveness and romantic validation. The poster overanalyzes their interactions (e.g., delayed messaging, jokey message backfiring) and interprets the cancellation and subsequent events as personal rejections ('him being hot and me being ugly'). This suggests heightened emotional sensitivity and stress related to self-worth and relationships."
"Consider this post: ""She said she always had to message first, and she decided to completely blank me when I apologised, and that was that. The first girl to ever express proper interest in me in my life ends up going completely down the drain. I don't know if it was because of my own management of messages or me being unattractive in general, but despite this great date occurring I only feel absolutely awful because of it in the end. Oh, and to rub salt into the wounds I even noticed she unliked my profile picture of all things. Ouch."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: While the post expresses disappointment and self-criticism ('I only feel absolutely awful'), the tone is more resigned and reflective rather than indicative of ongoing stress.

On a positive note, I've grown a ton, learned a lot, and am still kicking ass in this world! Here's to three years and many more anniversaries!"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

"Consider this post: ""Has anyone dealt with urinary retention as a side effect of lexapro? I've been taking lexapro for like 2 weeks or so, and in the past week it has become very difficult to pee, even at home (it sometimes takes a lot of pushing, and my bladder never feels like it's truly empty.). And the more I have to go, the harder it is, so I try to go often, like every 30 mintues or hour or so (even at night). I can barely eat or drink anything anymore. I did some research and it appears that urinary retention could be a side affect of lexapro."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post describes physical discomfort and anxiety related to a medication side effect (urinary retention), which is disrupting daily life ('barely eat or drink anything anymore'). The need to research and the focus on the problem indicate concern and distress, likely exacerbating stress levels."
"Consider this post: ""I'm completely overwhelmed. I think this process is about the best I can think of (below), but I really, desperately just want to dive back into my career. Am I wrong to think I'm not emotionally ready? Should I force myself to wait? Is there anything else I could plan on doing?""

Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of being overwhelmed, as indicated by the phrase 'I'm completely overwhelmed.' The poster expresses desperation to return to their career but questions their emotional readiness, showing internal conflict and uncertainty. The repeated questioning ('Am I wrong?', 'Should I force myself?', 'Is there anything else?') further highlights their anxiety and indecision, which are strong indicators of stress."
"Consider this post: ""Hey everyone, I’ve had quite the journey the last couple of years trying to get through a masters program in psychology to be a therapist and also dealing with health concerns. I came upon some research that led me to some conclusions that could possibly help some women who have gone through similar situations. So I was raped when I was 10 years old and gone through other various forms of trauma all throughout my childhood. I functioned pretty well until I got to my graduate program in clinical psychology. I had been in a stable relationship with a man who is supportive and loving so everything felt like it was going great.""

Reasoning: While the poster shares a history of significant trauma (e.g., childhood rape and other traumatic experiences), the tone of the post is focused on resilience and progress.

I've posted here before but just want to know what you guys think of this, recently someone passed away in there sleep from a heart attack and now I'm anxious like never before. I'll wake up with panic attacks and such."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post describes severe and persistent anxiety, particularly health anxiety, which has escalated to daily panic attacks. The trigger—a recent death from a heart attack—has intensified their fear, leading to disrupted sleep and heightened distress. The phrases 'I suffer daily and want it gone' and 'I'll wake up with panic attacks' clearly indicate significant emotional and physiological stress."

Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

Reasoning: The post reveals feelings of frustration, helplessness, and entrapment in an unhealthy relationship. The poster expresses dislike for their partner's treatment of them and vents about their lack of alternatives ('I hate being trapped in this situation').
