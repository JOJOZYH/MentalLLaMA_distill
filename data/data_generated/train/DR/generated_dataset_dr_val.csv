"Consider this post: ""what's it like coming off anti-depressants? I heard that if you're on them for longer than 3 months it's really difficult. You get brain zaps and all kinds of side affects. Is this true? Can somebody with experience please let me know whats it was like for you?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post inquires about the experience of coming off anti-depressants, which implies the poster has been prescribed them.

"Consider this post: ""I really need help making friends I'm 25, living with my parents. I recently quit my job, hoping to ease my depression but it only made it worse since I have nothing to distract me now. I lost touch with all of my high school friends after graduation, and didn't make any friends in college. I spend my days walking my dog, reading wikipedia articles, youtube, etc. I haven't spoken to another person since Monday. I just stay in my room and my parents don't come in. I don't have any hobbies, not even video games so I don't even have ""online"" friends. I have no friends or anybody to talk to. I realize this isn't a healthy lifestyle, and that I'm a loser. But I want to change. How do I meet people and make friends? When I meet people, what do I talk about?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post describes a lack of social connections, isolation, and a sense of being a 'loser.' The poster mentions quitting a job to ease depression but finding it worsened their condition due to lack of distraction. These are classic signs of depression, including low self-esteem, social withdrawal, and anhedonia (inability to find pleasure in activities)."
"Consider this post: ""So dramatic ðŸ˜ª My best friend and I were in the same school ever since we were 4 years old. But then, I had to leave for a different high school while she stayed with most of our friends. We didnâ€™t grow apart, but we spent most of our time with different people, which can change a person. Iâ€™d like to think that I did not change a whole lot (probably true :â€™) ) but my best friend has been hanging out with some of our friends and theyâ€™ve been affecting her attitude in a way, and sheâ€™s starting to become the same people we would always laugh at for being stupid and ignorant and petty. We talked about it and she agrees thatâ€™s sheâ€™s changed, but doesnâ€™t want her change to affect our friendship. What do you think we should do?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post focuses on a specific interpersonal issue with a best friend changing due to new social circles. While the poster expresses concern and sadness about the friendship dynamics, there is no indication of pervasive or chronic negative emotions, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The emotions are tied to a specific situation rather than a general state of mind."
"Consider this post: ""My dad's mad after game night. My family and I were playing board games two nights ago. We finished the first one which went well, it was fun. We switched to the second game that 4/6 of us had played before. After my brother finished explaining the rules my dad (who has played before) asked a really stupid question, so we thought he was joking. He then got really mad while we were answering his question, got up, and said he's not playing anymore. The next day we didn't say anything to each other. Today, we still haven't said anything to each other and he's clearly mad. Should i say something to him or let it pass?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post describes a conflict with the poster's father after a game night. The emotions expressed are situational and related to a specific event, with no indication of prolonged sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The poster is seeking advice on how to handle the conflict, not expressing ongoing emotional distress."
