"Consider this post: ""I'm finally dead inside and I don't know how to feel about it Fear, Anger, Sadness... It's all gone. I just feel numb"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster describes a state of emotional numbness, where they no longer feel fear, anger, or sadness. This complete lack of emotional response is a common symptom of depression, particularly in cases where individuals feel 'dead inside' or detached from their emotions. The absence of any positive or negative emotions suggests a significant depressive episode."
"Consider this post: ""what's it like coming off anti-depressants? I heard that if you're on them for longer than 3 months it's really difficult. You get brain zaps and all kinds of side affects. Is this true? Can somebody with experience please let me know whats it was like for you?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster is inquiring about the experience of coming off anti-depressants, which implies they are currently taking or have taken these medications. Anti-depressants are typically prescribed for depression or related mental health conditions. Their concern about withdrawal symptoms further indicates they have personal experience with depression treatment."
"Consider this post: ""I really need help making friends I'm 25, living with my parents. I recently quit my job, hoping to ease my depression but it only made it worse since I have nothing to distract me now. I lost touch with all of my high school friends after graduation, and didn't make any friends in college. I spend my days walking my dog, reading wikipedia articles, youtube, etc. I haven't spoken to another person since Monday. I just stay in my room and my parents don't come in. I don't have any hobbies, not even video games so I don't even have ""online"" friends. I have no friends or anybody to talk to. I realize this isn't a healthy lifestyle, and that I'm a loser. But I want to change. How do I meet people and make friends? When I meet people, what do I talk about?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster describes a lack of motivation, social isolation, and feelings of worthlessness ('I'm a loser'). They mention quitting their job in an attempt to alleviate their depression, which only worsened their situation. Their daily routine consists of solitary activities, and they express a desire to change but feel stuck. These are classic signs of depression, including low self-esteem, social withdrawal, and anhedonia (inability to enjoy activities)."
"Consider this post: ""So dramatic ðŸ˜ª My best friend and I were in the same school ever since we were 4 years old. But then, I had to leave for a different high school while she stayed with most of our friends. We didnâ€™t grow apart, but we spent most of our time with different people, which can change a person. Iâ€™d like to think that I did not change a whole lot (probably true :â€™) ) but my best friend has been hanging out with some of our friends and theyâ€™ve been affecting her attitude in a way, and sheâ€™s starting to become the same people we would always laugh at for being stupid and ignorant and petty. We talked about it and she agrees thatâ€™s sheâ€™s changed, but doesnâ€™t want her change to affect our friendship. What do you think we should do?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post focuses on a friendship dynamic and concerns about how a friend's behavior has changed over time. While the poster expresses some emotional distress about the situation, the content is primarily about navigating interpersonal relationships rather than exhibiting symptoms of depression. There are no indications of hopelessness, low self-worth, or other depressive symptoms."
"Consider this post: ""My dad's mad after game night. My family and I were playing board games two nights ago. We finished the first one which went well, it was fun. We switched to the second game that 4/6 of us had played before. After my brother finished explaining the rules my dad (who has played before) asked a really stupid question, so we thought he was joking. He then got really mad while we were answering his question, got up, and said he's not playing anymore. The next day we didn't say anything to each other. Today, we still haven't said anything to each other and he's clearly mad. Should i say something to him or let it pass?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post describes a minor family conflict following a game night. The poster is seeking advice on how to handle their father's anger, but there is no indication of depressive symptoms. The emotions expressed are situational (related to the conflict) and do not suggest a broader mental health issue like depression."
"Consider this post: ""My goal in life is to finally feel safe I'm at my boyfriends house. Been here a few days. I stay here every so often to escape my unstable home life, and hes all I have. I got a call from my dad. My childhood dog had to be putdown. Bone issues. Everytime I think of anything that gives me anxiety I feel the need to pick at my skin. My face is red and scabbed. I dissapoint everyone because I was the one destined to be smart and be the first (family name) with a degree and stable job. I turn 18 next month. No job experience. I get my photo id next week. Its very late because my parents lost my birth certificate. Set me back a lot. My mum is suddenly rushing for me to get Centrelink (welfare), so she can take half of each payment. We barely have food in the house most days because she uses her welfare on cigs and bills. I feel like I do nothing. Everyday is just nothing. In bed, video games, browsing internet, sex, video games, sad music and alcohol. Rinse and repeat. No joy. I want a social life and a hobby. I want a job. I want to not feel like im just laying down while everything falls apart on top of me. I want to feel safe and happy and like I give back and help people. I dont want to waste my life. I dont know why but I keep feeling like I'm going to die soon. I dont want to but its in my head. I dont want anxiety and i dont want to be pathetic and i dont want to be scared and i dont want to be bored and i dont want people hate me and i want to know what to do"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster describes a pervasive sense of hopelessness, lack of joy in daily activities, and feelings of worthlessness. They mention self-harm behaviors (skin picking), substance use (alcohol), and a lack of motivation or direction in life. The post also highlights significant family dysfunction and financial stress, which are contributing factors to their depressive state. The recurring theme of feeling trapped and the fear of impending death further underscore severe depressive symptoms."
"Consider this post: ""4 years Tuesday Tuesday will be the four year anniversary of when my dad committed suicide. My 21st birthday was this weekend and I got pretty drunk and started to think about it and I just cried and cried in the Uber with my friends. Iâ€™m really thankful for them. But there isnâ€™t a day that goes by that I donâ€™t think about him. The thing is, he was an asshole. To me and my mom. I didnâ€™t know he was depressed, I just thought he was mean and didnâ€™t love me. I really do think I couldâ€™ve prevented it if Iâ€™d known. Iâ€™ve been extremely depressed ever since it happened. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be normal again."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster explicitly states they have been 'extremely depressed' since their father's suicide four years ago. They express persistent grief, guilt, and a belief that they will 'never be normal again,' which are indicative of prolonged depressive symptoms. The emotional breakdown on their birthday and the daily intrusive thoughts about their father further support this conclusion."
"Consider this post: ""Feeling trapped in my head First off I'm Autistic, I'm studying at Oxford I'm struggling to remember anything, like anything at all, people, faces, dates, facts, etc. I'm feeling more and more alone because I don't feel like I have anything good to think about. I have a girlfriend, she's in the forces and has a lot of structure and meaning to her life and I like that but I see my life as completely pointless. So about a year I was cycling in the dark and I was hit by a car, I flew over the bonnet and hit my head. I was out for about half an hour, till I regained conscience in the back of an ambulance, and the crews were cutting off my clothes and pumping me full of morphine. Before this accident I had a very good memory, and my parent would say I could talk about anything that had happened from when I was a child. I was having some weird relationships at the time with different people, and I only came out to them after I was in hospital for a month after the accident, I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to worry them. I valued their feeling more over my own life, and I still do that now with other people. Things started to crash after the accident, I lost people really good friends and I knew it was me, and I changed and something during that accident had altered me, and I hated it. I started to forget people very quickly and events that had happened and horribly people who had died and continuously not realising they had died. That upset a lot of people. Before everything happened I had broken up with a girl (but i didn't realise that after), now I can't remember what we did together or even how we met, but I can't get the thought of her out my head, she later told me to leave never come back, which I did. But even now I still have the feeling of thought of her, and I'm struggling to get rid of that, I don't love her and I'm not in love her, I just feel like i'm obsessed with her a person I know nothing about and It haunts me. I've been to a few separate doctors and have been recommended medication, which I believe it has just made it worse. I've talk to my parents but they just talk highly of the pro's of medication and councillors. Hate councillors. (I always ended up lying to them) Since everything I've had some real down point, and made two attempts, by failed due to people walking in randomly either whilst in progress or while setting up. I've already made necessary precautions by writing letters, addressing them and stamping them but non have been sent. I want to tell my gf but I feel like, I don't want to throw feelings away by her thinking 'he's a sobbing kid, or he's crazy or why am I with him' - I'd rather hide it not to upset her, people mean everything in the world to me, and I'd give my life for her, any day. But I still want to tell her, and I don't her to be scared of me. When I close my eyes and think of a memory, I just see grey mist or static like of a television. It doesn't feel nice not having anything to fall back on in your mind, things that made you happy."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster describes profound feelings of loneliness, purposelessness, and memory issues following a traumatic accident. They mention suicidal ideation and two suicide attempts, which are severe indicators of depression. The obsession with a past relationship, self-sacrificial tendencies, and the inability to recall happy memories (visualizing only 'grey mist') all point to a deep depressive state. Their aversion to counseling and medication due to negative experiences further complicates their mental health struggles."
"Consider this post: ""Cried in a bathroom stall I'm not the type to post this kind of things, but I hate myself. I try my best to socialize, to be emphatic but I end up here every single time. Alone, boring and fucking depressed. Sometimes I think maybe I should be dead instead of someone else who had way better success at life than I did. I hate feeling this way and I take it out on my family when I can't control it. No matter how hard I try, socially I get nowhere, no friends, no relationships and no happiness. So here I am, if you guys know any sort of assassin hit me up, I might actually pay you to take me out. Save me the trouble of doing it myself. Peace out."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster openly expresses self-hatred, social isolation, and suicidal ideation ('I might actually pay you to take me out'). They describe chronic feelings of failure, worthlessness, and anger directed at themselves and their family. The post reflects a sense of hopelessness and a desire to escape their emotional pain, which are hallmark symptoms of severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""I guess Iâ€™m done with her? Or is there something wrong with my attitude? So, in the Literature class, we did a practice exam paper and we had a peer assessment. One of my friend had my paper and it turns out she graded mine the lowest in the class. The teacher was actually surprised on her harsh mark and said jokingly â€˜Hey, he (me) did all right. Isnâ€™t that too harsh?. Later I approached to her to ask what was it that she gave mine a low grade. Then, she rants out all the things Iâ€™ve done wrong, but she spoke so fast that I couldnâ€™t quite catch all of them. And I became a bit angry at her attitude because 1. She spoke so fast (so I couldnâ€™t quite catch 30% of her points) which is likely to be intentional so Iâ€™m startled before I can argue back. 2. Majority of her points were about that I lacked explicit points, but the teacher ticked all the points and said they were explicit enough? So, I said back to her â€˜Hey but the teacher said the essay was all rightâ€™ She scoffs and says: â€˜Yeah, write like that in the real exam and you will totally pass. Who are you kidding?â€™ Now I wouldnâ€™t really complain if she actually gave me valid constructive criticism, but she spoke so fast (likely to be intentionally) and most of her points came from simply her not reading carefully enough.. BTW, she actually achieves better grades than I do and is clearly smarter than I am. Not trying to be boastful, but in this Literature class, I really think itâ€™s safe to say that I get better grades than her most of the times. And, sheâ€™s not a teacher. What the hell does she know better than the teacher to say things like that, especially when she gets lower grades than I do most of the time??? Besides, she really always says rude things in front of someoneâ€™s faces (and many many times in front of my face).. and sheâ€™s sometimes in her own world and can get really arrogant and cynical. I guess Iâ€™m done with her right? Or is there something wrong with my attitude? I regretted a couple of times being friend with her in the first place, and now I really see that there can be no good staying with her. And, I'm in my final year before graduation... I feel quite embarrassed that I'm complaining about this kind of friendship problem and I know I should be focusing on studying, but thinking about this gets me angry every time."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post focuses on frustration and anger over a specific interpersonal conflict with a classmate. While the poster expresses strong emotions about the situation, these are contextually tied to the peer assessment incident and the friend's behavior. There is no evidence of pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The tone is more about venting and seeking validation for their reaction rather than displaying signs of a depressive disorder."
