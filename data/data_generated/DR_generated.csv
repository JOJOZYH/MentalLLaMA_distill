I don’t understand why I can’t appreciate what I have.",Question: The answer to the question 'Does the poster suffers from depression?' is,"yes.

I feel like such a burden to everyone around me. I don’t want to be like this, but I don’t know how to fix it.

"Post: I don’t know why I bother anymore. Every day feels the same—wake up, drag myself to work, come home, and stare at the wall until it’s time to sleep again. I’ve stopped answering texts from friends because I just don’t have the energy to pretend I’m okay. It’s not that I want to be alone; I just don’t know how to explain that I feel like I’m drowning and no one can see it. I’ve thought about therapy, but what’s the point? Talking won’t fix the fact that everything feels meaningless.","Question: The answer to the question Does the poster suffer from depression?"" is""","yes.

"Post: I feel like I’m trapped in a loop. I keep telling myself I’ll do better tomorrow, but tomorrow never comes.

I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to live like this either.","Question: The answer to the question Does the poster suffer from depression?"" is""","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits multiple symptoms of depression, including low self-esteem, lack of motivation, and difficulty maintaining daily routines.

My friends keep inviting me out, but I always make excuses because I just don’t have the energy. I feel guilty about it, but at the same time, I can’t bring myself to care enough to go.

"Post: I can’t stop overthinking everything. It’s like my brain won’t shut off, and I feel paralyzed by it. I second-guess every decision I make, no matter how small. Did I say the right thing? Did I offend someone? Am I doing enough at work? It’s exhausting, and I can’t seem to break free from it. I’ve tried meditation and exercise, but nothing helps. I just want to feel calm for once.
