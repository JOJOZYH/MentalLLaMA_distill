"Post: I feel like I’m drowning in my own thoughts. Every day is a battle to get out of bed, and when I finally do, I’m hit with this overwhelming sense of emptiness.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I feel like I’m losing control.",Question: The answer to the question 'Does the poster suffer from depression?' is,"no. Reasoning: While the post describes significant emotional distress, the symptoms align more closely with anxiety rather than depression. The poster mentions constant worry, difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbances, and irritability, which are common indicators of anxiety disorders. Although there is some overlap between anxiety and depression symptoms, the lack of explicit expressions of hopelessness, sadness, or loss of interest in life"
